Iceland has been increasing its activities and contributions to development cooperation within UNESCO in recent years.\nThe General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is currently being held in Paris. The Conference is held every two years and is the main policy-making and decision-taking authority of UNESCO. The Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture, Kristj\u00e1n \u00de\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edusson, addressed the Conference on behalf of the Icelandic authorities, since the Minister of Education, Science and Culture, Lilja D\u00f6gg Alfre\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir, was unable to attend. \nIn his address, the Minister announced Iceland\u2019s emphases for the candidacy, which will be voted on next week. This is a common candidacy of all the Nordic countries, since they share a strong emphasis on having Nordic representation on the UNESCO Executive Board. There are three candidates in the group of Western states, for the same number of seats. The other candidates are Austria and Turkey, and therefore there is no competition within the group. If Iceland is elected, it will hold its seat for a term of four years. State representatives on the Board can directly influence the implementation of various UNESCO programmes and policy areas.\nIn his address, the Minister also stressed the importance of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting a more equal access to technologies and digital solutions. He additionally encouraged a stronger push for gender equality within the organisation and increasing the participation of men in that effort, since gender equality is one of the cross-cutting objectives of UNESCO\u2019s policy. He also iterated the importance of a human rights-based approach in the organisation\u2019s programmes, with an emphasis on the rights and safety of LGBTI people.\nThe Minister also mentioned opportunities for education, since in many places there are considerable challenges in that area, especially because of the ongoing pandemic. An emphasis on sustainable development and the fight against the hazards of climate change is important in that respect. The address also underlined the necessity to continue to fight against information chaos and attacks on media freedom through the UNESCO platform. Iceland has been increasing its financial support for various UNESCO development projects lately, including media development and education in developing countries. \nNext Friday, the President of Iceland, Mr. Gu\u00f0ni Th.

{"date": "March 23, 2019", "title": "Fiscal Strategy Plan for 2020-2024: Increased resilience in the economy", "content": "The fiscal strategy for the years 2020-2024 reflects the strong position and discipline in government finances in a slower-paced economy. The strategy is a key factor in the important task of co-ordinating public finances, monetary policy and labour market developments to maintain economic stability and the prosperity people in Iceland are currently experiencing.\nThe fiscal strategy ensures a continued budget surplus. Taxation of households and businesses is being reduced, while the Treasury's debt position and interest burden continues to decline steadily. A National Fund will be established to respond to potential financial shocks. At the same time, substantial funds will be invested in facilitating the conclusion of collective bargaining agreements on the labour market and a substantial increase made in public investment when a decline in business investment is foreseen.\nTreasury debt resulting from the refinancing of the financial system has been fully paid off and other liabilities due to deficits in the past years have also been reduced sharply. This has substantially reduced the interest burden. Customs duties and commodity taxes on manufactured goods have also been abolished in recent years. Few countries in the world are now as open to international trade as Iceland. \nISK 4 billion in additional appropriations for transport projects\nThe Government's focus in the Medium-term Fiscal Strategy is based on the last fiscal strategy and the policy statement of the coalition parties. Broadly speaking, expenditures on the various government functions are similar to those outlined in the financial strategy for the years 2019-2023. Specific measures, general restraint and additional dividends have created scope for increasing appropriations to in this strategy to several areas.\nExcluding changes due to various technical adjustments, changes in the expenditure framework of the current fiscal strategy will amount to an ISK 2.6 billion decrease in 2019. The major factor here is the shifting of projects related to the construction of the new National University Hospital, together with various road construction projects.\nIn 2020, changes in to the expenditure framework of the previous strategy will amount to ISK 13.3 billion, ISK 20.2 billion in 2021, ISK 27.8 billion in 2022 and ISK 24.3 billion 2023. \nThe principal changes are the following:\n\nExtension of maternity/paternity leave to 12 months in 2020 and 2021; the cost of this action will amount to ISK 900 million in 2020, ISK 2.7 billion in 2021 and ISK 3.8 billion annually from 2022 onwards (in connection with collective wage agreements).\nAn increase of ISK 2.1 billion in the initial contributions to subsidised housing from the year 2020 to the year 2022 (in connection with collective wage agreements).\nA total of ISK 4 billion additional increase to transportation infrastructure projects from 2020 onwards.\nSignificant increase in appropriations to innovation projects. The largest items here are an ISK 1.1 billion increase from 2020 in connection with the EU Framework Programmes for education, research and technological development, increased contributions for reimbursement of costs to companies in research and development, as in the 2019 budget these contributions increased by ISK 1 billion and will increase by ISK 250 million annually from 2021 onwards. In addition, grants for innovation are expected to increase by ISK 500 million in 2020, by ISK 1.5 billion in 2021 and ISK 2 billion in 2022-2024.\nInvestment in hospital services will continue, with the construction of the new National University Hospital the most significant. The intention is to complete construction of the hospital in 2025. Total investment in hospital services will amount to more than ISK 74 billion during the period.\nAppropriations for new nursing home facilities will increase by ISK 500 million in 2020, ISK 1.5 billion in 2021, and ISK 2 billion in 2022 and 2023.\nChanges in the implementation of tax measures from the premises of the current medium-term fiscal strategy. These include ISK 1.6 billion in connection with child benefits, ISK 400 million to support book publishing and ISK 400 million to improve the operating environment of private media companies. \nIncreased appropriations for environmental affairs, especially in the context of the government's climate programme.\nChanges to the student loan system through a grant scheme.\nInitial grants for the purchase or construction of subsidised housing increase considerably in the years 2020\u20132022, amounting to ISK 3.8 billion annually. \nA new marine research vessel will be constructed during the period.\n\nProposals supporting the negotiation of responsible collective agreements\nWage increases during the upswing period, which has now lasted uninterrupted since 2011, have provided households with greater benefit than ever before. On the other hand, they have led to an increase in labour costs far beyond that of Iceland's main trading-partner countries, and thereby significantly reduced the competitive position of Icelandic companies.\nAll indications are that further general wage increases will in these circumstances lead to inflation and increased unemployment. The Government has submitted a number of proposals designed to facilitate the negotiation of responsible collective agreements. The aim is to increase support for construction of low-income housing and for first-time buyers, given that housing prices and rents have risen well in excess of wages in recent years. The increase in maternity/paternity leave payments and the extension of the leave period that the government intends to implement during its term of office also comprise an improvement to living standards.\nHousehold disposable income will increase substantially\nIn recent years, the government has systematically applied benefits and tax transfer systems to improve the situation of persons in greatest need of assistance and assist the private sector in meeting the high wage levels that characterise Icelandic business operations. \nIn 2014, the first cuts to personal income tax began; tax on intermediate incomes has been reduced by over 3 percentage points in three steps, in 2014, 2015 and 2017. Further changes to personal income taxes are planned, aimed at substantially increasing household disposable income, especially for the lowest income earners. The first phase of these measures came into force at the beginning of this year when the personal deduction was increased by one percentage point in addition to the statutory indexation increase and a 3.7% rise in the higher tax rate floor. The impact of this first phase is more advantageous to lower income groups than to those with higher incomes. \nIn February 2019, the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs announced plans for major changes to reduce personal income tax. These include the introduction of a new lowest level tax rate and changes to the cut-off points for higher brackets and to the personal deduction. The aim is to address specifically the needs of the lowest income groups in the labour market. \nThe proposals assume that the second half of the 0.5 percentage point reduction in employers\u2019 social security contribution will be implemented in 2020; the fee was reduced by 0.25 percentage points at the beginning of 2019. This reduction is intended to strengthen the operating environment for business and boost corporate competitiveness in light of major cost increases recently and thus give them increased leeway in their operations, among other things to meet wage demands. \nThe tax rate on financial income tax rose from 20% to 22% in January 2018. At the same time, the maximum exemption for interest income was raised and a review is planned of this tax base. The impact of this is still expected to be visible in revenue estimates for the second half of the electoral term. Finally, the proposal assumes that the bank levy will be reduced in four stages over the period 2020-2023, from 0.376% to 0.145%. The reduction is aimed at giving banks scope for a reduction in lending rates. This would improve the situation of both households and corporates, as the financial system White Paper stressed that the increasing cost-efficiency of the financial system would be passed on to consumers in a lower interest rate differential.\nIncreased resilience with debt reduction\nFollowing the continuous economic growth in recent years, the Treasury's financial position is strong. The Treasury has been operated with a surplus in recent years, and an additional fiscal surplus is anticipated in 2020-2024 amounting to around 0.8-1% of GDP each year.\nSignificant progress in reducing public and private sector debt, as well as economic changes, has given the economy greater resilience to external shocks. The Treasury's gross debt has declined rapidly in recent years, after peaking at ISK 1,501 billion in 2012, and is expected to amount to just over 830 ISK billion at year-end 2019. \nThe main objective of fiscal policy will be to continue to consolidate the Treasury's position as far as possible while increasing public activities, and especially investment, to offset slack developing in the economy.", "id": "0a7292d3d0383209a98d9b990e5ed46a"}

Six countries (Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Latvia and Norway) are part of the consortium, led by NOBID (Nordic-Baltic eID Project). The consortium\u2019s proposal will bring to life the most widely used of the European Union\u2019s priority use cases for the wallet \u2013 payments.\nAll the countries in the consortium have well-established digital infrastructures. Under NOBID\u2019s leadership following its successful harmonisation of several national eID programs comprising tens of millions of European citizens, the group will collaborate to show how payments and ID can be combined effortlessly, across borders and in multiple currencies. The consortium is being actively supported by leading digital government agencies, banks, enterprises and technology providers and will leverage the mature digital identity infrastructures of the six respective nations.\n\nThe EU digital identity wallet is a biometrically-secured app that, when it comes into being, will allow citizens across the continent to easily verify their ID, access public and private services and store sensitive digital documents in one place. The consortium\u2019s proposal to be one of four EU digital identity wallet pilots is fully aligned with the EU\u2019s key aims for its digital identity framework overall.\nThe consortium\u2019s proposal focuses on payments, one of the top priority use cases in the EU\u2019s digital ID wallet vision. Its implementation would leverage existing payment infrastructure to enable payment issuance, instant payments, account-to-account transfers and payment acceptance both in-store and online. It is designed to also complement wider EU plans to empower member states and streamline cross-border payments, such as the European Payments Initiative (EPI) and the Digital Euro. The project has unrivalled support from leaders in banking and payments, including DSGV in Germany, DNB and BankID in Norway, Nets in Denmark, Intesa Sanpaolo, PagoPA and ABILab in Italy and Grei\u00f0sluveitan in Iceland.\nTechnology partners participating in the consortium include Thales, iProov, Signicat, RB, Au\u00f0kenni, IPZS, Poste Italiane, Intesi Group, InfoCert, FBK and Latvian State Radio and Television Centre.

The transfer is based on an authorisation in the fiscal budget supplement for 2017, passed by Parliament on 30 December 2017.\nThe failed financial institutions\u2019 stability contributions, which were delivered in connection with an exemption from the capital controls, included holdings in the commercial banks, bonds, listed and unlisted equities, loans, and various other assets. A special State-owned company, Lindarhvoll ehf., was entrusted with the administration and redemption of assets other than those relating to the commercial banks. The company\u2019s tasks have been handled on the basis of a special agreement between it and the Ministry. The vast majority of the assets that Lindarhvoll ehf. was entrusted with liquidating have already been sold, with the proceeds reverting to the Treasury. The outstanding portion are not considered well suited to public sale in the manner employed for the assets sold by Lindarhvoll in the recent past.\nFor this reason, it is considered appropriate that LSR take over these assets, as the fund has the expertise needed to maximise the value of the assets and is not subject to any particular time limits with respect to asset management. The assets are transferred to the fund as a partial payment towards the Treasury\u2019s obligations vis-\u00e0-vis LSR\u2019s B-division. With this transfer, the value of the assets can be maximised and the associated cost minimised.\nThe Treasury remains liable for the obligations of LSR\u2019s B-division, and this transfer does not affect that liability.

Comments by international human rights organizations and coverage by international media indicate that we have passed that test,\u201d says Foreign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson in his opening remarks of the report.\n\u00a0\nIceland was elected to the Human Rights Council with a short notice. \"This was followed by intense effort by our staff, especially our Permanent Mission in Geneva.,\" says Foreign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson. \"There was a broad consensus on that Iceland should make a positive impact on the lives of people in states with a poor human rights record. Saudi Arabia had largely escaped criticism and there was a strong call for a UN review of the situation in the Philippines. As a response, Iceland led a group of states in a first ever joint statement bringing attention to the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia in March 2019 and in July 2019 the Human Rights Council agreed on Iceland's initiative to request a report on the human rights situation in the Philippines from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\"\n\u00a0\nThe report Iceland in the United Nations Human Rights Council looks at the situation leading up to Iceland's election to the Human Rights Council, the preparations involved and what issues were at the top of the agenda during Iceland\u2019s term. Furthermore, an attempt is made to assess Iceland\u2019s performance in the HRC and what lessons can be learned. The report raises the question of whether Iceland should in the future seek to be re-elected to the Council, in rotation with the other Nordic countries.\n\u00a0\nForeign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson introduced the report at a cabinet meeting last Friday and will present its findings at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Althingi soon.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe 43rd session of the Human Rights Council begins on Monday, February 24.\u00a0 Foreign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson will take part in its annual ministerial week.

As Iceland has few entry points and the lowest population density in Europe, the country has been able to move swiftly to identify, communicate with and, where necessary, quarantine Icelandic residents who have been travelling from high-risk areas and those who have been in contact with infected individuals.\n\u201cFrom the beginning, Icelandic authorities have taken important steps for effective detection of infections. Therefore, we have been able to identify a high number of infected individuals,\u201d \u00de\u00f3r\u00f3lfur Gu\u00f0nason, Chief Epidemiologist says. \u201cThe National Police has contacted all Icelanders who have returned from high-risk areas and those who may have been in contact with them to reiterate requirements for quarantine.\"\nAs of March 13, 2020, 1.021 individuals have been tested, and of those 118 are infected. Of those infected, most of the cases are associated with travel in high-risk areas and transmissions in Iceland can all be traced back to individuals who had been travelling there. The Government is committed to ensuring that employees under quarantine are guaranteed sick leave or benefits and is working with the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise and the Icelandic Confederation of Unions to create a mechanism for this. As of 13 March 2020, 1116 are under quarantine and 118 are in isolation. \n\n\u201cA proportionally high number of samples have been taken from arriving passengers and we have therefore managed to achieve early detection of infections. We are committed to keeping our residents and visitors as informed and prepared as possible and given the small population of Iceland this is easily achieved,\u201d says Alma D. M\u00f6ller, Director of Health. \n\nTo take these initiatives even further, Icelandic authorities are in cooperation with a prominent Icelandic biotech company, DeCode Genetics, for a nationwide assessment of the spread of the virus. This assessment will inform future actions to curb the spread of the virus. \nHigher alert level - what does that mean? \nOn March 6, 2020 the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police raised the alert level of the response to the COVID-19 virus outbreak to emergency phase, following the confirmation of the first transmission within Iceland. As of March 9, ten individuals have contracted the virus in Iceland after having come into contact with people who have recently travelled to high-risk areas. \n\nThis emergency phase activation has no significant impact on the public beyond those measures that had already been taken. \n\nHowever, this calls for response agencies and critical service providers to increase their preparedness activities. For the time being, no travel restrictions are in force. The Chief Epidemiologist and his staff are paying special attention to vulnerable groups, particularly the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. \n\nResidents of Iceland who arrive from areas with a high risk of infection are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days as a precaution and the same applies to people who have been in contact with infected individuals. There are no restrictions in place for travel to Iceland and no restrictions for tourists, as they are not likely to come into contact with vulnerable groups. \n\nPlease see:\n\nImportant information for tourists in Iceland about COVID-19\nInformation in English from the Directorate of Health\nEconomic response to COVID-19\n\nLast updated on March 13, 2020.", "id": "12dda83aa86c3e358a7424c2c3124068"}

{"date": "April 04, 2018", "title": "Fiscal plan 2019-2023 Improved social infrastructure, lower taxes and and better public services", "content": "The first Fiscal Strategy Plan of the coalition Government formed by the Left-Green Movement, the Independence Party, and the Progressive Party, reflects the Government\u2019s commitment to ensure that society as a whole will enjoy the benefits of the ongoing economic growth phase while strengthening social stability and the quality of life for the future.\n\nThe plan ensures that the policy of maintaining a fiscal surplus will continue, while promoting responsibility and steadfastness in public sector activities. The increased strength of the Treasury, lower interest costs, and the prospect of diminishing demand pressures in the economy put the Government in a good position to follow up on its goals of stepping up investment in social infrastructure and further supporting social welfare services. \n\nSince 2013, the outstanding debt of the Treasury has been lowered from ISK 1.500bn to less than ISK 900bn, or by a total of ISK 600bn. Lower debts along with the resulting reduction in interest costs have contributed towards a growing fiscal space. In addition, GDP has doubled from 1998 and is now higher than ever before. In spite of significantly increased allocations to all key spending areas, the public consumption of the central government will remain constant relative to GDP over the period, at around 11.2%. The increase in allocations therefore aligns well with the economy\u2019s capacity to finance improved services for the public at large.\n\u00a0\n\nPublic consumption\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSubstantial investment in infrastructure\n\nInvestment will grow markedly in 2019, or by just over ISK 13bn, and will peak in 2021. Over the period as a whole from 2019 until 2023, investments in all expenditure areas is projected to total ISK 338bn.\n\nLarge-scale investment in transportation infrastructure will be financed in part with a temporary increase in dividend payments from State-owned financial institutions. In all, investment allocations are projected at ISK 124bn over the period, and for three years beginning in 2019 a special annual contribution of ISK 5.5bn will be added. The nationwide installation of fibre-optic cable connections is scheduled for completion in 2020.\n\nTotal investment in hospital services is estimated at nearly ISK 75bn, most of it for the construction of the new Landsp\u00edtalinn hospital on Hringbraut. Construction of a new treatment centre for the hospital will begin in 2018, and the bulk of construction will take place in 2020-2023. \n\nThe fiscal plan also provides for further development of infrastructure and other projects pertaining to popular wilderness areas and other tourist destinations. \n\nOther large investments include the purchase of helicopters for the Coast Guard and construction of nursing homes as well as the House of Icelandic Studies.\n\nBetter services\n\nAllocations to healthcare will total about ISK 249bn per year by the end of the period. The aggregate amount will have increased by about ISK 40bn from 2018, or more than 19%, in real terms. Apart from the construction of Landsp\u00edtalinn hospital and real growth in the healthcare system, particular emphasis is placed on mental health services, on strengthening primary healthcare centres, and on reducing patients\u2019 co-payments. \n\nAllocations to social and housing affairs and benefit payments for the elderly and disabled will total about ISK 226bn through 2023. The cumulative increase in allocations totals ISK 28bn, a 14% increase in real terms. Changes are planned in the benefit system for disability pensioners so as to improve their living standards and promote participation in the community. It is also planned to increase maximum childbirth leave payments and lengthen the childbirth leave period. \n\nIn education and culture, allocations to university-level education will increase markedly. Contributions to universities were increased by more than ISK 2bn in the budget for 2018, and an additional increase of over ISK 2.8bn is planned for the period covered by the fiscal plan. The contribution per student increases as well, both at the high-scool and university level. In the area of arts and culture, significant funds will be devoted to an action plan for language technologies, in addition to the large allocations made in the 2018 budget. The country\u2019s main libraries will be strengthened, and professional artists\u2019 stipends and project funds will be supported. \n\nAllocations to environmental affairs will be increased by nearly ISK 4bn over the period, an increase of 35% from the 2017 budget. Preparatory work for the establishment of a national park in the central highlands will move foreward, land patrolling will be supported strongly, and allocations for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will be increased in line with the objective of making Iceland carbon-neutral by 2040. \n\nIn addition to an increase of ISK 900m for public security and criminal justice in the 2018 budget, it is now planned to increase allocations by nearly 14% in 2019. It is planned to improve border control and integrate border administration, in part based on Iceland\u2019s obligations under the Schengen agreement. In addition, allocations for law enforcement and the operation of the Coast Guard will be increased by over ISK 800m. \n\n\n\nTaxation measures\nIn the field of foreign affairs, it should be noted that allocations for development aid will increase from 0.26% of GNI this year to 0.35% by 2022. Contributions to the EEA development fund also increase over the period, and increases for defence cooperation with the US and membership of NATO are also planned. \n\nThe Government\u2019s aim is to continue to reduce the taxburden, make taxation fairer, and ensure effective tax monitoring. The Government intends to consult with the main social partners about plans to reduce the tax rate in the lower bracket of the income tax by 1 percentage point, in stages, and simultaneously to undertake a comprehensive review of the personal income tax system, alongside a review of benefits systems. Of particular concern is public support for families with children and housing support, with targeted financial assistance to less well-off households. \n\nThe payroll tax is to be lowered by 0.25% in 2019, from 6.85% to 6.6%. Further reduction will depend on, among other things, the results of consultation with the social partners concerning changes in labour market benefits funded with payroll tax, and the Treasury overall balance. \n\nValue-added tax on books will be eliminated at the beginning of 2019, and a year later, payments of royalties collected by recognised rights-holders\u2019 associations will be taxed as assets and not as income. \n\nThe special bank tax will be reduced from 0.376% to 0.145% over the period. Tax concessions for research and development costs will be increased in 2019, with the aim of removing the ceiling on them later in the period. The tax base for investment tax will be reviewed with the aim of taxing real returns. The impact of those changes will emerge in 2020. \n\nAt the beginning of this year, the carbon tax on fuel was increased by 50%. It is planned to increase it by 10% in 2019 and another 10% in 2020. Ways to collect fees from tourists will be explored. The aim is to generate revenue from 2020 onwards. \n\nGood cooperation with the labour market and continued debt reduction\n\nThe economy is well balanced at present, after strong growth in recent years. According to official economic forecasts and analysis, the outlook is for slower growth in coming years. The Government emphasises successful cooperation with the social partners so as to preserve economic stability and enhance social welfare. In this way, it will be possible to work towards favourable results from wage negotiations in coming years, so as to preserve the unusually strong real wage growth that has been achieved in recent years, through moderate pay rises that will continue to deliver increased purchasing power to households. \n\nThe fiscal plan assumes that there will be a continuing surplus on central and local government operations in each year covered by the plan, in accordance with the Fiscal Policy Plan that was presented together with the 2018 fiscal budget and has now been approved by Parliament. Treasury debt has been reduced markedly from the 2012 peak. The objective is to lower total public sector debt from 36% of GDP in 2018 to less than the legally stipulated ceiling of 30% of GDP by end-2019, a year earlier than envisaged in the Fiscal Policy Plan,and that the debt level will have declined to 22% of GDP at the end of 2023.", "id": "146af215f06a3e32bc378613a3e28488"}

This arrangement will continue, to enable persons wishing to declare their opposition to organ donation to do so by this means. Should the deceased have declared his or her opposition by other means, e.g. to a close friend or relative, this will also be respected.\nThe Althingi has repeatedly discussed the need to seek ways to increase the number of cadaveric organ donations.

This can be seen in the fiscal budget proposal for 2022, presented before Parliament today, together with the fiscal strategy for 2022-2026.\u00a0 \nThe proposal assumes a continued rise in healthcare expenditures, an additional increase in disability and rehabilitation benefits, a doubling of the tax-free threshold for old-age pensioners\u2019 employment income, continued reimbursement of research and development costs, and an increase in both child benefits and the means testing threshold for child benefits, to mention a few examples. \nYear-2022 GDP growth is forecast at 5.3%, bringing GDP above its pre-pandemic level. \n\u00a0\nSuccessful COVID response measures\nThe Government\u2019s responses to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were highly successful, as were efforts to support the economy through one of the deepest contractions in its history. The fiscal budget proposal assumes that mitigating measures due to the pandemic will total ISK 50bn in 2022, bringing the Government\u2019s pandemic-related economic support to ISK 260bn for 2020-2022.\nFiscal policy has been applied aggressively, delivering both increased economic activity and an better debt position than previously projected. The business community is well positioned to participate in the rebound. Real wages have risen, and public goods are distributed more equally in Iceland than in most other economies.\n\u00a0\nFaster turnaround \u2013 lower unemployment\nUnemployment has fallen swiftly in recent months and is now broadly at its pre-pandemic level, owing to the rapid economic turnaround coupled with the Government\u2019s labour market initiatives. \nNow that the impact of the pandemic and the measures introduced in response to it are tapering off, the labour market will be governed increasingly by conventional drivers of activity. Despite the strong recovery of the labour market, there is the risk that long-term unemployment will be higher than before, and all available tools must be brought to bear to ensure that it does not become entrenched. It is of pivotal importance that the framework of the labour market be such that wage agreements reflect economic conditions and deliver favourable results.\nTreasury outcome improves by ISK 120bn\nThe swift economic rebound can be seen in an improved outlook for Treasury performance, with the outcome set to improve by ISK 120bn between 2021 and 2022.\n\u00a0\nIt is essential to continue on this path. Now that the economy is picking up again, it is appropriate that discretionary support measures be allowed to expire and that focus be directed increasingly at promoting price and interest rate stability. Economic stability is the key to solidifying and making permanent the economic gains households have experienced in recent years. \nFoundation for targeted growth\nThe post-pandemic resurrection of the economy and Government finances is the most important task at the beginning of this electoral term. It is vital to return the Treasury to a position of strength and ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. By the same token, the Treasury must pull together with monetary policy in order to promote declining inflation and greater economic stability. These goals can be achieved with responsible fiscal policy focusing on clear reforms in Government operations and strong, lasting GDP growth.\nAn even stronger healthcare system \u2013 31% real increase relative to 2017\nAs in recent years, allocations to healthcare will take priority in terms of budgetary allocations. The fiscal budget proposal for 2022 assumes that allocations to healthcare will rise by ISK 16.3bn. This is the largest single expenditure increase provided for in the proposal, yielding a rise of just over 31% in real terms relative to 2017. \nOver a longer period \u2013 from 2010 to 2022 \u2013 healthcare expenditure has increased by 75%, from ISK 171bn to ISK 300bn, an average annual increase of 4.8% in real terms. \n\u00a0\nIncreased allocations to Landsp\u00edtali hospital alone amount to nearly 74% over the same period; i.e., from ISK 48.1bn in 2020 to ISK 83.7bn in 2022. \n\u00a0\nThe 2022 fiscal budget proposal provides for a contribution of ISK 2.6bn to further enhance Landsp\u00edtali\u2019s capacity to respond to the pandemic. Six critical observation spaces and 30 new rehabilitation spaces will be opened, and a special epidemic department will be established at the hospital in Fossvogur. \nKey projects for 2022\n\nISK 1bn \u2013 increased allocation to climate issues\nISK 800m \u2013 additional increase in disability and rehabilitation pensioners\u2019 benefits by 1% over and above general percentage increases, for a total rise of 5.6% relative to the 2021 National Budget \nISK 540m \u2013 to double the tax-free threshold for old-age pensioners\u2019 employment income from ISK 100,000 to ISK 200,000\nISK 10.4bn \u2013 for reimbursement of research and development expense\nISK 5.2bn \u2013 for nursing home construction\nISK 1.5bn \u2013 for investment in Digital Iceland\n\nA strong society of well-being and equal opportunity\nThe prioritisation of expenditure increases is consistent with the new Government\u2019s clear policy of building up a strong society featuring well-being and equal opportunity. At the same time, care will be taken to ensure that expenditure growth remains modest and that it supports economic policy now that the slack in output appears to be closing. \n\u00a0\nTax revenues to total ISK 955bn in 2022\nBuoyed up by a strong rebound and an improved economic position, Treasury revenues appear set to be ISK 66bn higher in 2022 than was assumed in the fiscal plan introduced this past spring. Total Treasury revenues will amount to ISK 955bn.\nThe improved position is due primarily to a marked rise in revenues from personal income tax and payroll tax, as well as an increase of ISK 16bn in income tax on legal entities over and above the assumptions in the fiscal plan. Consumption taxes will also generate considerably more revenue, and value-added tax is now estimated to generate ISK 10bn more than previously projected. \nTotal revenues estimated at ISK 66bn higher than in the 2022-2026 fiscal plan\n\u00a0\nNevertheless, Treasury revenues are growing from a lower baseline level than would have existed without the economic impact of the pandemic. Treasury operations are still expected to be in deficit in coming years; however, the deficit will be considerably smaller than was assumed in the fiscal plan. \nContinuing reduction in personal income tax\nBroad-based tax system reforms were undertaken during the last electoral term. Chief among these was a marked reduction in personal income tax, which increases households\u2019 disposable income by ISK 23bn. The last phase of the personal income tax reforms takes effect at the end of 2021. The main focus of the changes has been on reducing lower-income households\u2019 tax burden. \nISK 88.4bn in investments, anchored by Landsp\u00edtali construction project\nTreasury investment is projected at ISK 88.4bn on a national accounts basis in the 2022 fiscal budget proposal. It will then total 2.5% of GDP, well above its long-term average.\nThe largest single project in the budget proposal is the construction of the new Landsp\u00edtali hospital, to which ISK 14bn has been allocated in 2022. Other investments provided for include, but are not limited to, reimbursements of research and development expense, ISK 10.4bn; transportation system construction, ISK 31.5bn; nursing home construction, ISK 5.2bn; and Digital Iceland, ISK 1.5bn.\n\u00a0\nVastly improved debt ratio on the horizon\nIn the wake of the pandemic, the Treasury\u2019s debt ratio was projected to rise to 30% by the end of 2020. The fiscal plan currently in effect assumed that debt would continue to rise in 2021 and 2022, to 42% of GDP. But because of the strong turnaround in the economy, the outlook is significantly improved. Debt is now projected to be roughly ISK 200bn lower by end-2022 than was assumed in the fiscal plan, giving a debt ratio of 34% of GDP instead of 42%.\n\u00a0\nThe improved debt position is due for the most part to a stronger-than-projected economic recovery, but also to the successful sale of 35% of the State\u2019s holding in \u00cdslandsbanki for ISK 55.3bn. If market conditions are favourable, further measures will be undertaken to actively manage the Treasury balance sheet and further reduce State ownership in the financial system through the sale of an additional stake in \u00cdslandsbanki. The proceeds will be used to reduce the Treasury\u2019s borrowing need, thereby creating the scope for continued infrastructure development and other socially profitable endeavours. \nEqual rights integrated into the decision-making process for the first time\nFor the first time, Government ministries submitted an equal rights assessment with their recommendations for the fiscal budget proposal. This makes equal rights an integral part of the budgetary decision-making process. Assessments were made of the impact that the vast majority of budgetary measures would have on equal rights. Most of them are considered conducive to gender equality, and many more are considered to maintain the status quo. A small share of the measures are considered likely to widen the gender gap.", "id": "18183a2236b333618330a6f79c321c3c"}

On the occasion of this event the Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC), of which Iceland is a member, hosts a virtual global event and Call to Action to encourage all labour market actors to take the necessary steps to ensure that equal pay is at the heart of recovery efforts worldwide.\n Last November, a resolution on International Equal Pay Day was adopted by the Third Committee of the General Assembly. A group of EPIC member countries, led by Iceland, joined in presenting the resolution establishing September 18 as International Equal Pay Day to be observed each year. The resolution follows the resolution on Equal Pay, presented by the same group of countries and adopted by the Human Rights Council in July 2018.\n The objective of the International Equal Pay Day is to raise awareness of measures to commit to promote equal pay and to encourage further action to achieve the goal of equal pay for work of equal value in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.\n According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) the gap in earnings between women and men stands about 20 percent globally and 13 percent within the OECD member states. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the nations of the world must remain more vigilant than ever and fight against wider inequalities. According to the ILO, there is strong evidence that the impact of the pandemic on labour markets has been more negative for women than men and they are also at greater risk of losing their jobs.\n It is therefore of great importance that the governments, trade unions, employers and other stakeholders respond to the Call for Action on 18 September.\n The virtual global event begins with a joint address by the national leaders of the EPIC countries, including Gudni Th. J\u00f3hannesson, President of Iceland, as well as leaders of international organizations associated with EPIC, e.g. ILO, OECD, International Organization of Employers (IOE), International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and UN Women.

During this period, all arriving passengers must stay in quarantine in case of a possible infection. Those who test negative in the second PCR-test are no longer required to take special precautions. Those who test positive must self-isolate. Children born in 2005 and later are exempt from the double border-screening procedure. \nAll arriving passengers are still required to preregister before arrival.

The enterprise has been given two months to appeal the decision.\u00a0\nThree years ago, the Icelandic authorities, Promote Iceland and SA Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise decided to take legal action against Iceland Foods Ltd., which in 2014 registered the word mark \u201cIceland\u201d with the European Union Intellectual Property Office. Iceland demanded the invalidation of this registration by Iceland Foods Ltd. on the basis that the mark in question is a well-known geographical term and also that the mark \u201cIceland\u201d is generic and not distinctive and should never have been registered.\n\u201cI applaud this decision even though it is not altogether surprising to me, since it is contrary to common sense for a foreign company to be able to appropriate the name of a sovereign state as was being done in this case. This is an incremental victory in a case that is very important for Icelandic export enterprises. Our country is known for quality and sustainability and therefore there is value in referencing to the origin of Icelandic goods\u201d, stated Gudlaugur Th\u00f3r Th\u00f3rdarson, Icelandic Minister for Foreign Affairs.\nThe decision that was issued on April 5 upheld all of the Icelandic entities' claims in full. It has been sufficiently demonstrated that consumers in the EU countries are aware that Iceland is a European country and likewise that the country has strong historical and economic ties to the EU countries, as well as being geographically close to them. Consumers therefore associate the mark with the country of Iceland for all goods and services the registration is claimed for, or are likely to do so in the future. The mark is therefore first and foremost descriptive of geographical origin and does not fulfil the requirement for distinctiveness, which is one of the main prerequisites for the registration of a trademark.\u00a0\nIceland Foods Ltd. still retains its word-and-image mark its \u201clogo\u201d which is registered in Europe and elsewhere, and is able to continue to trade under the name. The deadline of Iceland Foods Ltd. to appeal the decision to the Board of Appeal expires on June 5th. This ruling has no bearing on the wordmark in the UK, where it is registered with the UK IPO.\nIceland was forced to take this legal action after Iceland Foods pursued and won legal action against multiple companies from Iceland seeking to use their country\u00b4s name as a source of identity or branding on the basis of the company\u2019s ownership of the wordmark \u2018Iceland\u2019.

The fishery can begin on March 10 and the maximum length of nets for each boat is unchanged from last year.\nBy-catch of marine mammals and seabirds a problem in the lumpfish fishery and is the main reason for the withdrawing of MSC certification for the fishery in in 2018.\u00a0 The main reason was substantial by-catch of seabirds as well as harbour seal and grey seal in the lumpfish net. Both seal species are on the list of threatened species. \nBy law set in 2019 (36/2019) the Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture was granted right to decide on regulation framework for seal hunting, but no such law had been in place before. On the basis of the law, the Minister issued a regulation in December 2019 prohibiting all seal hunting\u00a0 as well as any marketing of seal products.\nIn order to react to the high by-catch of seabirds and seals in the lumpfish fishery as well as to enhance increase in the seal populations, several actions have been taken:\n\nIn the autumn 2019, the Minister appointed a group of experts to advise on possible actions to reduce by-catch in the lumpfish fishery and how inspections can be improved.The group delivered a report in December and proposed several actions, including improved inspection by the Directorate of Fisheries, shortening the soak time of nets,improved reporting by fishermen as well as writing of a manual for species identification of possible by-catch A substantial increase in inspections coverage by the Directorate of Fisheries has already been decided as well as to follow other direct proposals from the expert group. In line with their suggestions, the maximum soak time for the nets is now 3 days instead of 4 in past years.\nThe Directorate of Fisheries has prepared an app for cell phones or computers where position of vessels are automatically registered.Captain of the boat reports in a simple way catches of lumpfish, condition of catches as well as by-catch by species and numbers.It is hoped that these changes in the reporting requirements leads to improved reporting, including improved identification of by-catch. Furthermore, fishermen will receive a manual on how to identify birds and marine mammals that have shown to be caught in the fishery.\nThe Association of Small Boat Owners presented proposals for the closure of 14 areas in Faxafl\u00f3i, Brei\u00f0afj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, Vestfir\u00f0ir, Strandir, H\u00fanafl\u00f3i and Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur.

Enclosed is picture showing the 14 areas that has been closed.\n\nThe regulation aims at reducing by-catch of seabirds and marine mammals in lumpfish fisheries and to attain agreed management goal for harbour seal in Iceland. The goal is that the harbour seal stock\u00a0shall be around 12,000 animals, but according to the last count in 2018, the stock size was estimated around 9,500 animals.\nThe Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture hopes that the measures that are now put in place will reduce the by-catch of mammals and seabirds and, thus, will enhance the growth of these stocks.

{"date": "January 04, 2018", "title": "New Icelandic law on Equal Pay Certification entered into force on January 1, 2018", "content": "A bill of law (amendments to the\u00a0Gender Equality Act\u00a010/2008\u00a0) that was submitted by the Minister of Social Affairs and Equality and passed by the Parliament with vast majority on June 1, 2017 came into force on January 1, 2018. Companies and institutions employing 25 or more workers, on annual basis, will be required to obtain equal pay certification of their equal pay system and the implementation thereof. The purpose of this obligatory certification is to enforce the current legislation prohibiting discriminatory practices based on gender and requiring that women and men working for the same employer shall be paid equal wages and enjoy equal terms of employment for the same jobs or jobs of equal value.\nThe approved amendments entailed changes to article 19 on Equal Pay.\u00a0\n\nAn English translation of the Gender Equality Act\u00a0\n\nShort summary:\n\nThe new legislation makes Iceland the first country in the world to require companies with 25 or more employees to obtain certification on the basis of requirements of a management standard to prove they offer equal pay for work of equal value regardless of gender. The certification requires companies with more than 25 employees to not only offer equal pay across the same job level, but also equal pay for work of the same value. The Equal Pay Standard, on which the certification requirements are based, does this by assessing a company's pay policies, classification of jobs according to equal value and wage analysis on the basis of the classification, as well as formalizing policies and processes related to pay decisions.\nIn view of the time that it will take to adopt equal pay management systems that meet the requirements of the standard, workplaces receive a grace period in which to acquire the certification. For this, different periods are allowed according to the size of the workplace (see further information below).\u00a0\nIceland is spearheading the move as part of its target to eradicate the country's gender gap by 2022, which would make it the first country in the world to achieve this.\nIceland's Equal Pay Standard \u00cdST 85 is the first to be deliberately developed according to international ISO standards, allowing it to be translated and adopted across the globe.\nThe Centre for Gender Equality will grant workplaces that acquired certification on the basis of the audits performed by accredited auditors the right to use a special equal pay symbol in recognition of this.\nIn cases where a workplace either has not acquired equal pay certification or has failed to renew it by the deadline, the organisations of the social partners will be able to report it to the Centre for Gender Equality. The centre can impose on the workplace a formal demand to rectify the situation by a certain deadline. Rectification measures can involve, for example, the provision of information and release of materials or the drawing up of a scheduled plan of action on how the workplace intends to meet the requirements of the Equal Pay Standard. If the workplace fails to act on instructions of this type, the Centre for Gender Equality is authorised to impose per diem fines.\n\nWhat is the Equal Pay Standard?\n\nThe Equal Pay Standard is a management requirement standard, an administrative tool designed to establish and maintain gender equality in wages within a workplace. Equal pay certification under the standard is designed to confirm that when decisions on pay are taken, they are based only on relevant considerations.\u00a0\u00a0\nEqual pay certification therefore does not involve any requirement to the effect that individuals should receive exactly the same wages for the same work or for comparable work. It is still recognised that employers will be permitted to take into consideration individual factors, factors applying to groups and particular personal skills and abilities when deciding wages.\nNevertheless, it does make the inflexible demand that decisions on wages are based on relevant considerations, such as individuals' qualifications, experience, responsibilities or job performance, such things not involving gender discrimination of any type, direct or indirect.\nThe standard could also be used to eliminate discrimination based on other grounds such as ethnicity, sexuality and nationality.\n\nWhy was the Equal Pay Standard developed?\n\nEven though Iceland has been ranked in the first place in international comparisons regarding gender equality, equality in practice has not been achieved in all areas in Icelandic society.\nThis applies not least to the domestic labour market, where many surveys and studies have revealed an entrenched gender pay gap, generally to women's disadvantage. Notwithstanding the clear intention of the legislature, ever since the first legislation on equal pay was passed in 1961, followed by the passing of the Gender Equality Act in 1976, undertakings by the Icelandic state under international conventions and numerous measures taken by the government to promote gender equality in the labour market, gender equality in terms of equal pay has yet to be achieved in Iceland.\nIt is therefore considered necessary to secure equal pay for equal work or work of equal value through equal pay certification based on legislation.\nThe advantages that will follow from the enactment of the legislation are seen as outweighing the argument that it will impose undue encumbrances on the companies and institutions involved. In addition, it cannot be maintained that enactment of the legislation will be disproportionate when measured against the lawful aims of the Gender Equality Act.\u00a0\n\nWhat does the legislation entail?\n\nThe legislation allows for the prescription of an obligation on the part of companies and institutions that employ 25 or more workers to earn equal pay certification by accredited auditors, following an examination, stating that their equal pay management systems and the way they are implemented fulfil the requirements of the Equal Pay Standard (\u00cdST 85; see Article 1c of the standard).\nWorkplaces employing fewer than 25 workers will, of course, continue to be able to request equal pay certification on the basis of the standard as has been the case hitherto.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe legislation took effect January 1st\u00a02018. In view of the time that it will take to adopt equal pay management systems that meet the requirements of the standard, the workplaces receive a grace period in which to acquire the certification. For this, different periods are allowed according to the size of the workplace.\u00a0\u00a0\nWorkplaces employing 250 or more workers are required to obtain equal pay certification by the end of 2018. Here it was assumed that workplaces of this size would have sufficient infrastructure in place to enable them to introduce equal pay management systems in line with the Equal Pay Standard, and consequently they would be in a position to obtain equal pay certification earlier than others. Workplaces employing 150-249 workers are required to obtain certification by the end of 2019, while those employing 90-149 workers are granted grace period until the end of 2020. Workplaces employing 25-89 workers are required to obtain certification by the end of 2021.\nWithout prejudice to the above-mentioned time frames, public institutions, funds and companies that are half-owned or more than half-owned by the state with an average of 25 employees, or more, on an annual basis, shall have acquired certification no later than 31 December 2019. The Icelandic government ministries, operating under the Icelandic Government Ministries Act, No. 115/2011, shall have acquired certification, no later than 31 December 2018.\nThe minister may, by means of a regulation, lengthen the grace period granted for companies or institutions to acquire certification or confirmation under the first paragraph by up to 12 months.\nThus, the aim is to adopt obligatory equal pay certification in stages over a period of four years, as to provide businesses with adequate leeway in which to meet the requirements laid down in the legislation. In this way, it was envisaged that the experience of the largest workplaces, which would be certified first, would be of use to smaller workplaces following in their wake.\nAs a means of further securing the aims of the legislation in the long term, companies and institutions are required to have their equal pay certification renewed every three years.\nAs stated in the Equal Pay Standard, before work on its implementation commences, senior management are to define the policy in force in their companies or institutions regarding wage equality, as they were already required to do under the Gender Equality Act. \u00a0They are also required to have a wage analysis carried out in the workplace. This consists of a systematic examination of employees' wages and terms with a view to establishing whether gender-based discrimination in wages is being practised. \u00a0It is required that the considerations on which wage decisions are made to be specified. The wage for each job is to be based on requirements applied equally for all jobs. On the basis of the comparison, jobs are ranked together as different or equal in terms of value for the purpose of deciding wages. No requirement is made to the effect that any one specific wage system is to be used for this purpose; instead, it is demanded that the system used does not involve discrimination on grounds of gender. In order to ensure that this is the case, it is demanded that regular wage analyses are to be carried out.\nIn conclusion, it should be mentioned that the standard requires that the equal pay policy of the company or institution in question is to be accessible and that it give sufficient information to make it possible to assess its effectiveness.\u00a0\n\nHow is compliance of companies and institutions ensured?\n\nThe organisations of the social partners are commissioned to monitor compliance of workplaces employing 25 or more workers with the law, namely that these workplaces acquire equal pay certification and that it is renewed every three years. It was envisaged that further provision will be made by means of regulations specifying how such monitoring is to be effected following consultation with the organisations of the social partners.\nIn cases where a workplace either has not acquired equal pay certification or has failed to renew it by the deadline, the organisations of the social partners will be able to report it to the Centre for Gender Equality. The centre can impose on the workplace a formal demand to rectify the situation by a certain deadline.\nRectification measures can involve, for example, the provision of information and release of materials or the drawing up of a scheduled plan of action on how the workplace intends to meet the requirements of the Equal Pay Standard. If the workplace fails to act on instructions of this type, the Centre for Gender Equality is authorised to impose\u00a0per diem\u00a0fines. Appeals can be referred to the Minister of Social Affairs and Equality against a decision to impose\u00a0per diem\u00a0fines.\nThe Minister of Social Affairs and Equality shall have assessments made every two years of the results of certifications and confirmation of the equal pay systems of companies and institutions under the legislation.", "id": "2273c20679913916ac10dd12211978c4"}

No exemptions will be granted to those arriving from regions or countries where the 14-day incidence rate exceeds 700 per 100,000 population. High-risk areas are defined as regions or countries where the 14-day incidence rate per 100,000 population exceeds 500 or more or from where sufficient information is not available.\nQuarantine in a quarantine facility without exceptions: Passengers arriving from areas where the 14-day infection rate is 700-1,000 cases per 100,000 must without exceptions quarantine at a quarantine facility while awaiting results from the second test after arrival in the country.\nQuarantine in a quarantine facility with the possibility of an exemption: Passengers arriving from areas where the 14-day infection rate is 500-699 cases per 100,000 must quarantine at a quarantine facility unless the Chief Epidemiologist grants an exemption. Such an exemption must be applied for at least two days before arrival in Iceland.\nHome quarantine: Those arriving from areas where the 14-day infection rate is below 500 cases per 100,000 can quarantine in a facility of their own choosing provided it fulfils the requirements of the Chief Epidemiologist for home quarantine.\nThe provisions on compulsory stay in a quarantine facility have a legal basis in Act no. 23/2021 on amendments to the Communicable Diseases Act and the Act on Foreigners, which were passed by the Althingi Parliament on 22 April. The change in the law includes contains for example a temporary provision authorizing the Minister of Health to issue a regulation obliging tourists who either reside in or are coming from a high-risk area, or an area for which adequate information is not available, to quarantine or isolate in a quarantine facility.

According to the accounts, the outcome was positive by ISK 42bn, as compared with a surplus of ISK 84bn in 2018. Revenues totalled ISK 830bn and operating expenditures ISK 809bn. Net financial expense was negative in the amount of ISK 57bn, and the share in earnings of Government-owned companies was positive by ISK 78bn.\n\n\u201c2019 saw the end of a nine-year GDP growth phase, the longest in Iceland\u2019s history. The tourism boom played a major part in the upswing. During that time, the authorities demonstrated the foresight to strengthen public finances substantially by pursuing responsible fiscal policy. Treasury debt was reduced rapidly, agreements were reached on the settlement of a sizeable share of the State\u2019s pension obligations, and reorganisation of the public mortgage lending system\u2019s large loan portfolio commenced. Alongside the strong performance of recent years, the authorities also enacted various tax reforms and allocated substantial funding to shoring up Iceland\u2019s infrastructure and social welfare system. The Treasury balance sheet for 2019 shows clearly that the State is well prepared for more challenging times: at the end of the year, the debt-to-GDP ratio was at its lowest since 2008, and well within the limits according to the debt rule in the Act on Public Finances,\u201d says Bjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs.\u00a0\nPerformance for the year according to reporting standards poorer than previously estimated\nWhen the Treasury performance according to the Government accounts is compared with the performance target in the fiscal plan and the fiscal budget, it is done using the GFS standards. On that basis, the overall Treasury outcome for 2019 was negative by ISK 39bn, which is ISK 24bn poorer than was provided for in the revised plan for the year. The 2019 fiscal budget assumed an overall surplus of ISK 28.6bn.\u00a0\n\nThe balance sheet changed significantly at the beginning of 2017, in part because tangible operational assets were capitalised from then on. The balance sheet now gives a clear overview of the Treasury\u2019s assets, liabilities, and equity. Total assets amounted to ISK 2,355bn at the end of 2019, and liabilities were ISK 1,947bn. Equity totalled ISK 408bn, a decline of ISK 205bn, owing primarily to the implementation of changed financial reporting practices.\nA strong fiscal position enables the Government to support the foundations of society and put the economy on a secure footing\u00a0\nSigns of coming economic headwinds were already evident in early 2019. The tourism sector, one of the pillars of the domestic economy, sustained a severe blow with the collapse of one of Iceland\u2019s two international airlines. A slowdown in growth ensued, and a sizeable decline in tourist visits was in the offing. This quickly gave way to a weakening of economic activity and rising unemployment. Indeed, the Treasury\u2019s poorer performance as reflected in the Government accounts for the year is due largely to the direct and indirect impact of this setback.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges facing the authorities at present is to create favourable conditions for the economic recovery and a new growth episode. Emphasis will be placed on profitable investments, education, increased baseline research, and innovation that will enable Iceland to emerge from the temporary hardships currently prevailing. It will also be necessary to improve capital utilisation, boost public sector efficiency and productivity. The Treasury has scope to take on additional debt, which better enables the authorities to protect the foundations of society and put the economy on a secure footing without sacrificing fiscal sustainability,\u201d says the Minister about the Government accounts.", "id": "2ac82e4e05a43e7686b70358326a9721"}

Activities of many types involving more than 10 participants will be prohibited. The decision by the Minister of Health to impose these tougher restrictions was based on proposals from the Chief Epidemiologist for an immediate response in view of group infections that have arisen in the country over the past few days so as to limit the spread of the virus. The new rules will remain in force for 3 weeks.\u00a0\nAll the new group infections that have broken out in Iceland involve the B.1.1.7 strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is more readily transmitted than most other variants and is considered to cause\u00a0rather more serious illness. In the light of the fact that the B.1.1.7 strain\u00a0has been shown to have more serious implications for older children, the Chief Epidemiologist urged that the restrictions apply to children as young as six years old. Apart from this, the rules now taking effect are broadly similar to those imposed on 31 October last year, which proved effective in quelling the third wave of the pandemic in Iceland.\u00a0\nPrincipal rules now taking effect:\nThe social distancing requirement remains 2 metres, and the rules on the use of face-masks are unchanged. As hitherto, children born in or after 2005 are not required to wear face-masks, but are now included in the count when limiting the size of gatherings and must observe the 2-m social distancing rule.

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs was founded as an independent entity in April of 1940, responsible for the foreign policy of the Kingdom of Iceland.\u00a0\nOne of the main roles of the Foreign Service has always been assisting Icelanders abroad. As the 80th anniversary is now celebrated in the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic, many Icelanders have been reminded of this vital role, in particular those returning from abroad with the assistance of the Ministry\u2019s consular services.\n\"We mark this milestone now in the face of unprecedented global challenges,\" says Gu\u00f0laugur Th\u00f3r Th\u00f3rdarsson, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development Cooperation. \"In the time of crises, we are reminded of the importance of international and regional co-operation among countries, while staying focused on guarding the interest of Icelandic citizens at home and abroad. Despite being small in numbers of staff, the Foreign Service has been able to scale up its consular services and show great flexibility to be able to assist almost 12 thousand Icelanders travelling abroad. \"\nIceland is actively involved in the global multilateral system, international development cooperation and bilateral cooperation. In the first years following 1940, the Foreign Service focused on establishing diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries while negotiating agreements related to trade, air transport and defence, and strengthening cultural ties regionally.\u00a0\nIn the first decade of the Foreign Service, Iceland joined the World Bank as a founding member in 1945, the United Nations in 1946, a year after the organisation was founded, and as a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in 1949.\u00a0\nFree trade relations and regional co-operation have always been an important pillar of Iceland\u2019s foreign policy. In 1970 Iceland joined the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and signed the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1992. Throughout the years Iceland has also played an active role within the Nordic Council of Ministers and the Arctic Council. In addition to that, Iceland is engaged as a member of several other international organisations such as the Council of Europe, OECD, OSCE, and WTO, as well as funds, agencies and other entities of the UN system. Over the past couple of decades Iceland\u2019s foreign policy priorities have focused on promoting gender equality, human rights and sustainable development.\nThis year also marks the centennial of the Icelandic Embassy in Copenhagen, which was opened in 1920, following the 1918 Union Act with Denmark. Leading up to the establishment of the Republic of Iceland in 1944, a Consulate General was opened in New York in 1940, followed by embassies in London and Stockholm the same year, the embassy in Washington in 1941 and the embassy in Moscow in 1944. Today Iceland has 26 diplomatic missions in 21 countries around the world and 240 Honorary Consuls in over 90 countries. Furthermore, six ambassadors are based in Reykjavik, accredited to a number of countries.\nTo mark the 80th anniversary of the Foreign Service, the Ministry has launched a historical overview on the website of the Government of Iceland (only available in Icelandic).", "id": "2c081ea8234c3719b802dfa133f8d353"}

DALL-E and ChatGPT are the company's best-known products to date, but they could be described as a text builder and conversation tool that users can question on almost anything. The technology is based on countless texts from the web, on which artificial intelligence is trained to scrutinize, analyze, and base its answers. While it was possible to use Icelandic to some extent in GPT-3 and ChatGPT, the new language model, GPT-4, makes it much more proficient. For the past few weeks, 40 volunteers have been working on behalf of the language technology company Mi\u00f0eind in collaboration with OpenAI, to train GPT-4 to respond better in Icelandic. The cooperation on the implementation of the Icelandic language is one of six special development projects that OpenAI is working on in connection with the release of GPT-4, but the only one related to a nation's language. This cooperation may become a model for other less widely spoken languages.\nWhy language technology?\nLanguage technology includes all technologies that enable software to deal with language, and is now intertwined with the development of such technologies. The increased use of artificial intelligence is opening up unprecedented possibilities in the use of large digital text, language, and information libraries. The language technology program aims to ensure that Icelandic is used in all areas of computer and information technology that affect the daily life of the general public. This includes, among other things, ensuring that software in devices can understand and work with Icelandic as it does with other languages.\nAlmannar\u00f3mur is the Icelandic language technology center that has led the country\u2019s implementation of the language technology program. Its website sets out its current core solutions, which include speech recognition, language reviewers, and speech synthesizers. Since the language technology program's products are open, anyone is able to use them in the development of user software, and the core solutions are available for download and search. Entrepreneurs, companies and startups, linguists, speech pathologists, and language technology experts, from the United States and elsewhere, are among the data's users.

The company can no longer stop Icelandic enterprises from identifying themselves with their country of origin when marketing their goods and services in the European Economic Area.\nThe case concerns the basic interests of Icelandic enterprises engaged in foreign trade. The Icelandic authorities, in partnership with Business Iceland and the SA Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise, filed Iceland\u2019s request for a declaration of invalidity with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2016.\u00a0Oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal were held last September. The Icelandic State\u2019s 2016 request that EUIPO invalidate the word mark ICELAND was based on the trademark not fulfilling the legal requirements for registration as a European Union trademark.\nIn 2019, the EU Intellectual Property Office accepted all of the Icelandic State\u2019s requests when it concluded that the retail chain\u2019s trademark registration of the word mark ICELAND was invalid in its entirety. In its ruling of December 15, the Grand Board of Appeal confirms all the points of that finding. The time-limit to appeal the finding to the Court of Justice of the European Union\u00a0is 15 February 2023.\n\u201cThis unequivocal finding of the Board of Appeal is very pleasing; however, this entire case is rather absurd,\u201d said Minister for Foreign Affairs \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Kolbr\u00fan Reykfj\u00f6r\u00f0 Gylfad\u00f3ttir. \u201cIt is of prime importance for Icelandic export enterprises to be able to refer to their origin, especially considering that our country has a reputation for purity and high quality.

{"date": "May 15, 2018", "title": "Statement on Responsible Fisheries in Iceland", "content": "This statement is presented by several responsible parties in the Icelandic fishing industry, the minister of fisheries, the Marine Research Institute, the Directorate of Fisheries and the Fisheries Association of Iceland. This statement is a part of providing information about the Icelandic fishing industry and how measures are taken to ensure responsible fisheries and the proper treatment of the marine ecosystem around Iceland.\n\nThe statement is intended for everyone concerned about the status of the fish stocks and responsible fisheries, particularly the numerous parties that purchase and consume Icelandic fish products.\n1. Icelandic fisheries are responsible fisheries\nThe fishing industry is one of the main pillars of the Icelandic economy. Responsible fisheries at the Icelandic fishing grounds are the prerequisite for the Icelandic fishing industry continuing being a solid part of the Icelandic economy and a principal pillar in Iceland\u2019s exports.\nIcelanders have structured a fisheries management system to ensure responsible fisheries, focusing on the sustainable utilization of the fish stocks and good treatment of the marine ecosystem. The fisheries management in Iceland is primarily based on extensive research on the fish stocks and the marine ecosystem, decisions made on the conduct of fisheries and allowable catches on the basis of scientific advice, and effective monitoring and enforcement of the fisheries and the total catch. These are the main pillars of the Icelandic fisheries management intended to ensure responsible fisheries and the sustainability of the ocean\u2019s natural resources.\n2. The catch limitation system is the cornerstone of the fisheries management system\nThe catch limitation system is the cornerstone of the Icelandic fisheries management system. The system is intended to limit the total catch and to prevent more fishing from the fish stocks than the authorities allow at any given time.\nThe catch limitation system is based on the catch share allocated to individual vessels. Each vessel is allocated a certain share of the total allowable catch (TAC) of the relevant species. The catch limit of each vessel during the fishing year is thus determined on basis of the TAC of the relevant species and the vessel\u2019s share in the total catch.\nThe catch share may be divided and transferred to other vessels, with certain limitations.\n3. Stock assessments and fisheries advice in conformity with international criteria\nStock assessments and scientific fisheries advice are the main foundations of the decisions made by the authorities on the TACs each year.\nIn Iceland the Marine Research Institute carries out research on the ocean\u2019s commercial stocks and provides the authorities with fisheries advice. The Marine Research Institute is an independent institution that falls under the auspices of the Ministry of Fisheries and is the main research body in Iceland conducting marine and fisheries research.\nStock assessments are based on systematic research of the size and productivity of the fish stocks and the marine ecosystem. Active collaboration with international scientific organisations ensures that the focus is on internationally acknowledged research methods that provide the best available information on the condition of the fish stocks around Iceland at any time.\nPrior to the Marine Research Institute\u2019s advice on the total catch being published, the institute\u2019s assessment of the size and condition of the main fish stocks is presented to and evaluated by relevant committees of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Additionally, there is collaboration with other multi-national organizations, including NEAFC (Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission) and NAFO (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization), when addressing stocks occurring beyond the Icelandic Exclusive Economic Zone. Collaboration with international organisations in this field ensures that the Marine Research Institute is working in conformity with demands that meet international criteria.\n4. Deciding the total allowable catch (TAC) based on scientific grounds\nThe minister of fisheries determines the annual TAC of every species subject to quota regulation. A scientific assessment of the state of the fish stocks and the condition of the ecosystem constitutes the main basis of determining the TAC each year.\nConformity between the scientific fisheries advice and the authorities\u2019 decisions on the TAC is a principal factor for ensuring responsible fisheries management. The authorities\u2019 decisions on the maximum catch are based on social and economic factors, yet always focused on ensuring the long-term renewal of the fish stocks. The Icelandic authorities have implemented a utilization strategy with the long-term objective of ensuring sustainable fisheries.\n5. Effective catch control and enforcement\nEffective control is an inseparable part of the responsible fisheries management and ensures that the catches in Iceland are well in conformity with the TAC every fishing year.\nThe Directorate of Fisheries is responsible for the implementation of laws and regulations regarding fisheries management in Iceland and for monitoring and enforcement regarding the fisheries operation and the fish processing. The Directorate is a public institution that falls under the Ministry of Fisheries. All commercial fisheries are subject to authorization by the Directorate of Fisheries.\nAny catch brought ashore is to be weighed by accredited harbour officials. Upon completion of weighing, the relevant harbour authorities register the catch in the central database of the Directorate of Fisheries, which ensures a steady overview of the status of the allowable catch of every vessel and how much has been taken from the fisheries quota. The fisheries inspectors of the Directorate of Fisheries monitor the correct weighing and registration of the catch. Information on each vessels allowable catch and quota use is regularly updated and made public and accessible to all on the Directorate\u2019s web-site, as mandated by law, thus ensuring transparency.\nThe fishing gear is subject to effective monitoring, as well as the composition of the catch and its handling onboard the fishing vessels. The inspectors have access to the catch logs, which state the location of the fishing activity, the day of the catch, the type of fishing gear used and the catch quantity. If such control reveals the presence of much small fish or juveniles at the fishing grounds, the Marine Research Institute temporarily closes the relevant fishing grounds without delay.\nThe Iceland Coast Guard, which falls under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, monitors the fisheries of vessels operating in Icelandic waters, as well as monitoring closed areas. Additionally, it inspects the fishing gear, for example the mesh size of the nets.\n6. Reliability of catch information ensured\nThe effectiveness of monitoring of the fisheries and catch control is reflected, among other things, in the observed good conformity between the TAC and the real catch every year.\nAnyone purchasing and/or selling catches is obligated to present reports to the Directorate of Fisheries, containing information on the purchase, sale and other disposition of fish catches. If discrepancy materializes in the database of the Directorate of Fisheries between the information stated in the reports and the information received from the harbour weighing, measures are taken when this is deemed appropriate. This ensures independent checking of the accuracy of information about the catches that are brought ashore.\nExperience shows that there is good conformity between the catch information of the Directorate of Fisheries and the information about the total fish export as registered elsewhere. This conformity illustrates the reliability of the catch information.\n7. Severe penalty for breaches of the fisheries management legislation\nBreaches of the law and regulations on fisheries management are subject to fines or revoking of the fishing permit, irrespective of whether such conduct is by intent or negligence. Major or repeated intentional offenses are subject to up to six years imprisonment.\nIf the catch of a vessel exceeds the allowable catch of the said vessel of individual species, the relevant fishing company must obtain an additional catch quota for the relevant species. If this is not done within a certain timeframe, the fishing permit may be revoked as well as a charge having to be paid for the illegal catch.\n8. Extensive research of the impact of fisheries on the marine ecosystem\nExtensive knowledge of the ocean around Iceland and its ecosystem is the foundation of decisions on sustainable fisheries and other utilization of the natural resources of the sea.\nThe Marine Research Institute carries out wide ranging and extensive research on the status and productivity of the commercial stocks, and long-term research on the marine environment and the ecosystem around Iceland. The results of this research are the foundations of the advice on sustainable catch level of the fish stocks. Additionally, the institute investigates fishing gear and its impact on the ecosystem, including bottom trawl, line, net and mid-water trawl fisheries and the fishing gear\u2019s selectivity. Research on the impact of fishing gear is among other things aimed at minimizing to the extent possible such impact on the ocean\u2019s ecosystem.\n9. Special measures for protecting small fish and the ecosystem\nVarious special measures are taken to ensure the protection of small fish and vulnerable habitats, such as regulations on the type of fishing gear allowed in different areas and the closing of fishing grounds. Such measures include rules on the minimum mesh size and the use of small-fish sorting grids.\nIf monitoring reveals that the percentage of small fish in the catch or the by-catch exceeds guideline limits, the Marine Research Institute may close the relevant fishing area for a short period of time. Such a fishing prohibition enters into force within a few hours. If small fish or by-catch repeatedly exceeds guideline limits, the relevant area is closed for a longer period of time.\nVarious area closures are in effect for longer periods of time and the Ministry of Fisheries enters the decisions on such long-term closures into force. The closures may apply to specific fishing gear, fishing-vessel size or all fishing for certain periods of time. Annually, such temporary closures of areas are in force to protect spawning grounds of cod and other demersal species. Additionally, in some areas the use of bottom fishing gear is totally prohibited, for example where there is coral and in other vulnerable areas.\n10. Clear rules on discards and the disposition of by-catch\nCollecting and bringing ashore any catches in the fishing gear of fishing vessels is obligatory. Discarding catch overboard is prohibited and such conduct is subject to penalty according to law.\nIf a vessel catches any species in excess of its fishing permit, the relevant fishing company has the option of obtaining additional quota within a certain period of time after landing the catch. Vessels are authorized to land a small percentage of the catch, usually by-catch, without the use of quota. The catch in question is sold at auction and the proceeds go to a research fund that supports marine research.\nThe Directorate of Fisheries and the Marine Research Institute conduct research and estimate discarded catches. The results indicate insignificant discards by the Icelandic fishing fleet.\n11. Steady improvements\nFisheries management in Iceland has a long history and the fisheries management system has been under development for decades with a focus on the fisheries being both economical and sustainable with respect to the natural resources\u2019 utilization and renewal.\nIn recent years, measures have been taken in strengthening an ecosystem approach to the fisheries management in Iceland. Increasing emphasis is placed on research and development of methods in this field, and on fisheries advice that takes into account various interrelated factors in the ecosystem, such as the interaction of the species, environmental change and multi-species impacts. The focus is furthermore on strengthening research on the effects of fishing gear on the ecosystem, particularly on the seabed and the living bottom communities.\nThe Icelandic fishing industry and the authorities will continue to fully promote responsible fisheries management and to work against any illegal fisheries on the international scene.\nIcelanders have the ambition to be in the forefront of responsible treatment of the natural resources of the ocean. Hence, steady improvements are made of the fisheries management in Iceland and its scientific basis and measures are taken to strengthen the dissemination of information on the Icelandic fisheries.\nReykjav\u00edk, August 7th 2007\nThe parties to this statement guarantee that the information provided herein correctly illustrates the fisheries management in Iceland and in particular how firm measures are taken to secure sustainable utilization of the renewable natural resources in the ocean around Iceland.\nSigned by:\nThe Minister of Fisheries, Einar K.

{"date": "October 11, 2018", "title": "Government accounts 2017", "content": "The results of the Government accounts for 2017 have now been published and the accounts sent to Parliament. The accounts show a surplus of ISK 39bn, showing Iceland\u2019s strong fiscal position. Revenues totalled ISK 783bn and operating expenditures ISK 711bn. Net financial expense was negative in the amount of ISK 74bn, and the share in earnings of Government-owned companies was positive by ISK 40bn. \n\n\u201cIn the past several years, Iceland\u2019s economy has grown apace, and Government operations have improved markedly. Now, however, there are signs that the cycle has peaked and that the economy is moving towards a new equilibrium after wide fluctuations in recent years. The Treasury is strong, and the fiscal situation has improved due to systematic deleveraging and robust GDP growth. In spite of this strong position, it is important to remain steadfast and cautious in fiscal management. Government expenditures have risen somewhat in recent years, in line with improvements in the Treasury position, but it is clear that spending growth cannot continue indefinitely at the pace of the past few years,\u201d said Bjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, about the outcome of the Government accounts. \n\n\n\nFirst publication pursuant to the Act on Public Sector Finances\nThe Government accounts for 2017 are the first to be published in accordance with provisions in the Act on Public Sector Finances. New financial reporting methods are being introduced according to a special three-year timetable, under which the 2019 Government accounts will be fully compliant with international financial reporting standards for public entities. \n\nThe Government accounts include an initial balance sheet from the beginning of 2017, which includes major changes in presentation and content from the 2016 accounts. The treatment of tangible operational assets has changed in that they are capitalised and written off in accordance with their useful economic life instead of being charged upon acquisition. The Treasury\u2019s holdings in companies are assessed using the equity method; i.e., the State capitalises its share in their equity. Obligations that the Treasury has undertaken and must meet in the future, such as those due to accrued wage-related rights, are entered to the balance sheet. With these changes, the Treasury balance sheet gives a clearer overview of Treasury assets and liabilities. Total assets as of end-2017 were ISK 2,137bn, while liabilities totalled ISK 1,639bn and equity ISK 498bn. \n\nIt should be noted that the outcome of the Government accounts is published in accordance with the international public sector accounting standards (IPSAS), whereas the overall outcome in the fiscal plan and the fiscal budget are published according to the Government finance statistics (GFS) standards. Both methods are intended to ensure consistency and international comparability. The Treasury outcome according to the Government accounts is therefore not comparable to the performance targets laid down in the fiscal plan and the fiscal budget. According to preliminary figures from Statistics Iceland, the overall 2017 outcome according to the GFS was positive by ISK 31bn, which is an improvement of ISK 6bn over and above the assumptions in the fiscal budget, a clear sign of the Treasury\u2019s strong position. \n\n\n\u201cIt is vital that the fiscal strategy be characterised by prudence and steadfastness, and there is much to be gained in doing what we can to strengthen social and economic stability. In this context, it is worth mentioning the review of the monetary policy framework and the work we are doing to prepare for the future, with refinancing and retirement of debt,\u201d said the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs. \n\n\u201cWe must continue to ensure responsible handling of Government finances, as this creates the scope for improvements and reforms in services for the public, as well as strengthening the economy and improving Icelanders\u2019 living standards,\u201d the Minister continued. \nRatified by electronic signature\nThe Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, the State Accountant, and the Auditor General ratified the Government accounts by electronic signature.

The same rules will apply throughout Iceland. The main change introduced now is that the maximum size of gatherings is reduced from 20 to 10 persons. All sporting activities and stage performances are suspended. It is envisaged that these stricter rules will remain in force until 17 November (including that date); they will be reviewed in the light of developments with a view to whether it will be possible to relax them earlier or necessary to extend the period for a longer period.\nIn his memorandum to the minister, the Chief Epidemiologist noted that the level of infection in Iceland is still high, notwithstanding the tighter precautionary measures that were introduced on 20 October. Consequently, there is a danger that group infections will break out and place even more strain on the health services, which are already stretched to capacity. Landsp\u00edtalinn, the national hospital, is operating under emergency rules due to the demands of dealing with the pandemic and many services planned as part of its ordinary schedule have had to be suspended until 15 November. The five quarantine centres currently in operation for COVID-19 patients under great strain, with rising numbers of cases of infection among those in isolation there.

I sincerely hope that the Arctic continues to be a region of peace, stability and constructive cooperation,\" said Foreign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson at a press conference after the meeting.\nBilateral trade was also discussed at the meeting between the two ministers. Icelandic fish exports to Russia came to halt in 2015 due to Russia\u2019s restrictions of food imports from Western countries. \u00a0Minister Th\u00f3rdarson reiterated his disappointment over the restrictions, which have hit Icelandic exporters disproportionally hard. \u201cStill there are also many positive developments.

The results are presented in the newly published report Relations between Iceland and the Faroe Islands \u2013 Proposals for the Future.\n\"Icelanders and Faroese are close neighbours, we have a common ancestry and, in many ways, shared history.

However, bilateral relations and co-operation between these neighbouring nations can be expanded upon in various fields e.g. with regard to economics, culture and politics.

The requirement of maintaining a distance of at least one metre is abolished at sports events and stage art events in addition to further relaxations detailed below. The Minister of Health presented these changes at a government meeting this morning and they are in keeping with the Chief Epidemiologist\u2019s recommendations. A corresponding regulation takes effect on the 28th of August and is applicable until the 17th of September. \nIn the Chief Epidemiologist\u2019s memorandum it is e.g. stated that since the entry into force of the currently applicable regulation on the 25th of June the pandemic has been slowly declining in Iceland. It has also come to light that the risk of infection among non-vaccinated people is double in comparison to those who are vaccinated and the risk of hospitalization is four times higher and they are six times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Therefore it can be asserted that widespread vaccination in Iceland has prevented infections and in particular prevented serious consequences of COVID-19. The Chief Epidemiologist notes that the spread of the virus following the removal of all domestic restrictions at the beginning of July has been fast and he therefore emphasised caution in lifting the restrictions domestically and at the borders in the near future.\u00a0\nRestrictions on social gatherings from 28th of August to 17th of September\n\nThe restrictions on the number of people who are allowed to gather in one location is still set at 200, social distancing at 1 metre, and the obligation to wear a face mask remains.\nPublic swimming pools are permitted to run at maximum capacity subject to the conditions of their operating licence.\u00a0 \nHealth and fitness facilities are permitted to run at maximum capacity subject to the conditions of their operating licences.\nSports:\u00a0Participators at sport practices and competitions may be 200.\nThe one metre rule will cease to apply among spectators at sports events and stage art events.\nSale of food and beverages is allowed during breaks at sports events and stage art events. \nAuthorisation for 200 people in performing arts, both during practice and at performances.\nThe one metre rule ceases to apply at ceremonies of religious and life stance organisations.\nMuseums are allowed to run at maximum capacity according to the conditions of their operating licence subject to the 1 metre rule.\nRestaurants are allowed to receive 200 customers in the same space.

These arrangements will be carried out in close cooperation with those hosting large events.\u00a0 The provisions of the new regulation about restrictions on gatherings relating to the use of rapid tests at events take effect on the 3rd of September and will then be presented specifically.\n\nCOVID-19: Z dniem 28 sierpnia nast\u0105pi z\u0142agodzenie \u015brodk\u00f3w do walki z epidemi\u0105", "id": "3978d81b72ee3368b8e18e3960dd8a89"}

This is the first step in a carefully managed process to open the country to the flow of international travel.\n\n\"Throughout the pandemic, we have aimed for moderate but targeted measures based on the best available information. By testing all inbound passengers we will continue to collect valuable information that will help guide our decisions on removing regions from our list of high-risk areas in the future, or implementing a more careful approach,\" says Thorolfur Gudnason, Chief Epidemiologist. If and when a country is removed from Iceland's list of high-risk areas, it may be possible to reduce or eliminate the quarantine requirement for some portion of travellers.\n\nFrom the outset of the pandemic in early February, Iceland has pursued a policy of early detection, high volume testing, exhaustive contact tracing, quarantining of at-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. Additionally, innovative treatment methods, including high-touch remote care, have contributed to a successful effort to reduce mortality, morbidity, and strain on medical resources. Primary schools in Iceland have remained open, and no lockdowns have been imposed. There are still restrictions on mass gatherings (no more than 500 people), and restaurants and nightlife establishments must close by 11 in the evening. In case new infections are detected, and even small clusters of infection, there is a high level of confidence that it will be possible to deal with such issues in a targeted manner, on the basis of the current strategy, without implementing severe society-wide measures.\n\nDuring the pandemic, a very high emphasis has been placed on personal hygiene measures, such as handwashing, respiratory hygiene (coughing into the elbow), respecting distance when possible, and that anyone showing symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19 goes into self-isolation until they get tested. These personal practices remain of utmost importance in the upcoming weeks and months.\n\n\"A crucial factor in our success so far is that we have been able to count on the active participation of the general public. So far, we have all been in this together. The public has shown tremendous solidarity in our efforts to minimise the harm caused by COVID-19 in our country. This level of common commitment has allowed us to pursue a policy of sensible social distancing with much less drastic measures than have been implemented in many other places. We are certain that this level of common responsibility will be shared by the visitors we welcome in the coming days, weeks, and months,\" says Thordis Kolbrun R Gylfad\u00f3ttir, Minister of Tourism, Industry and Innovation.\n\nThe execution of Iceland's policy has been successful in mitigating the pandemic so far. There are only a handful of known COVID-19 infections in Iceland. A total of 1 810 individuals have been diagnosed with the virus, of which ten have died, and 1 796 have recovered. The Icelandic authorities aim to protect the progress achieved while giving the economy a path to recovery and normalcy. \n\nThe Icelandic authorities have not recommended the general use of masks or cloth for healthy individuals, and the use of such equipment in public is very rare. \"Iceland benefits from its sparse population. There are very few situations in daily life in here Iceland where the use of face masks would be advised. These recommendations are consistent with our experience, the best scientific information, and the latest recommendations of the WHO,\" says Mr Gudnason. He points out that the WHO recommendations on the use of face masks for healthy individuals in the general public are limited to specific situations such as where population density is high, there is little control of the outbreak, quarantine, and isolation operations are limited, and several other factors that do not apply to the situation in Iceland.\n\nThe current policy of testing every inbound visitor is under constant review. The government will pay for the tests for travellers arriving during the initial trial period until the end of June. From 1 July, a fee of ISK 15 000 (approx. EUR 100, USD 110, GBP 90) will be charged for those who elect to get tested (minors born 2005 and later are exempt from both testing and quarantine requirements). This fee is intended to cover the direct cost of the service.\n\nFor detailed information regarding your trip to Iceland, including a link to your preregistration form, please see www.covid.is/english\u00a0\n\nFor entry requirements for foreign nationals, other than EU, EFTA, and UK nationals, please see the website of the\u00a0Directorate of Immigration.\n\nFor press inquiries, please contact Mar\u00eda Mj\u00f6ll J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

Very large pension fund assets and sizeable deposits underpin financing flexibility. The rating is constrained by the small size of the economy and limited export diversification.\n\nThe Negative Outlook reflects the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Icelandic economy and the resulting deterioration in the public finances, with the fiscal deficit having widened materially and government debt set to increase sharply from pre-pandemic levels over the next few years. As a small and highly open economy with a sizeable concentration in tourism and commodity exports, Iceland is heavily exposed to the pandemic shock. \n\nIceland has high flexibility to finance large fiscal deficits arising from its response to the pandemic shock over the next few years. The economy has proved more resilient to the pandemic shock relative to Fitch\u2019s initial expectations. Preliminary data from Statistics Iceland indicate that real GDP contracted by 6.6% in 2020, a better outturn relative to the 8% contraction at Fitch\u2019s October 2020 rating review, mainly due to stronger domestic demand. Strong household balance sheets and government support measures contributed to a rebound in private consumption in 2H20.\n\nIn Fitch\u2019s view, parliamentary elections in 2021 could lead to a fiscal strategy with a slower debt reduction path, but Fitch believes that broad political support for rebuilding fiscal buffers and a strong track record of public debt reduction of 70pp of GDP in 2011-2019 support fiscal policy credibility over the long run.\n\nFuture developments that could result in a positive rating action are greater confidence that the government debt to GDP ratio will decline over time once the Covid-19 crisis has subsided; sustained economic recovery, for example supported by evidence that the export-oriented sectors, particularly tourism, have been resilient to the pandemic shock.\t\n\nFactors that could lead to a negative rating action are evidence that the government\u2019s economic and fiscal strategy will fail to arrest the increase in government debt/GDP ratio over time; severe and prolonged economic weakness, for example due to a delayed recovery in the export-oriented sectors, sustained correction in the real estate market and material adverse impact on the banking sector; capital outflows at a scale that precipitates macroeconomic instability or erosion of fiscal buffers.\nFitch: Rating Action Commentaty", "id": "3ccf995a11003e8095d6437a407b08ab"}

{"date": "March 29, 2023", "title": "Medium-term Fiscal Strategy Plan 2024-2028: to counter inflation, safeguard living standards and support growth", "content": "The government's fiscal strategy plan for the next five years lays out its strategy to utilise fiscal policy in a targeted manner to counter inflation and overheating by increasing expenditure restraint and revenue generation and postponing public investments. At the same time, important basic services that the government has significantly reinforced in recent years are maintained, based on the strong position of the Treasury. Financial support will be provided for those groups least able to withstand the impact of rising inflation, as was done with the government's support actions during the pandemic and the previous year.\nThe Treasury\u2019s fiscal position has improved significantly in recent quarters, and the fiscal outlook for this year appears likely to be better than implied by the most optimistic scenarios of previous projections. Eighteen months ago, the objective was set in the government\u2019s Fiscal policy statement to halt the increase in debt to GDP ratio no later than by year-end 2026, however this goal now appears to be within reach as early as the end of this year.\nThis is explained in the new Medium-term Fiscal Strategy Plan for 2024-2028. The Treasury's primary balance is expected to be ISK 74 billion better this year than anticipated in the budget, and to show a surplus of ISK 24 billion if current estimates prove correct. A positive primary balance means that government revenues for the year are higher than expenditures excluding interest income and expenses. It would be the first positive primary balance since 2019 with this milestone being achieved a year earlier than anticipated in the last fiscal strategy. The surplus in the primary balance is important to ensuring the arresting of the rise in the debt to GDP ratio and is a major step towards returning a positive overall balance by the end of the plan period.\nIf the current estimates prove correct, the improvement will mean that the Treasury will dampen demand and thus reduce inflationary pressure in 2023.\nConsiderably lower public debt ratio\nThe rapid improvement in the Treasury\u2019s primary balance and the country\u2019s strong economic recovery have resulted in a substantially lower debt ratio for the Treasury and the public sector than previously expected. The 2021-2025 Medium-term Fiscal Strategy estimated that public sector debt would be around 55% of GDP at year-end 2022. In fact, this figure was 40% of GDP, which is quite low by international comparison.\nBalance regained\nThe consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the rapid growth of the economy play a major role in the rise in the inflation rate in Iceland. Although still below the European average, inflation is a definite concern, and it needs to be reduced. Iceland entered the current period of inflation from a strong position in terms of purchasing power and the development of living standards. It is important for the public to preserve the major purchasing power advances of recent years so they will not diminish through long-term inflation.\nThe government's role in such circumstances is to reduce its impact on demand in the economy and continue to improve its fiscal performance. Doing so counteracts both inflation and the current account deficit. At the same time, the financial plan provides targeted support for those groups least able to withstand a higher cost of living.\nHowever, the Treasury's heavy debt service and role as lender to public entities mean that some borrowing will be needed every year and the debt level will rise in nominal terms even though the primary balance has become positive. In 2024, the Treasury is expected to pay interest of some ISK 48 billion. Added to that is ISK 49 billion of imputed interest on unfunded pension obligations and inflation indexation.\nThe most effective way to reduce this interest burden is to concentrate on reducing inflation and lowering the debt level as much as possible. Towards the end of the plan period, the primary balance is estimated to be positive by 1.3% of GDP and Treasury debt is projected to have been reduced to 30% of GDP.\nA joint project\nIt is very important that the positive development of the Treasury balance and debt ratios continue. In the short term, the fiscal strategy is co-ordinated with actions of the Central Bank of Iceland to bring inflation back to target as soon as possible. The government emphasises exercising expenditure restraint through prioritising expenditure items within the current expenditure framework and reducing new expenditure. Thus, the line ministries efficiency target for next year will be doubled from 1% of appropriations to 2%, with the exception of schools, where the reduction will be 0.5%. Police departments will be temporarily exempt from these requirements in 2024\u20132025, and prisons, healthcare, and geriatric institutions, as well as social insurance and health insurance, will be exempt for the entire plan period as before. In addition to this, a special additional efficiency target will be imposed on the ministries main offices increasing the total level of their efficiency target from 2% to 3% next year.\nFurther work on consolidating state institutions\nEmphasis will be placed on reducing state expenditures over the medium-term by utilising opportunities in digitisation, coordinated purchasing and re-evaluating real estate needs. The focus will be on merging smaller operating units and increasing joint operations and shared utilisation of facilities. Reducing the number of square metres of state office space is estimated to save around ISK 2 billion per year by the end of the period.\nA special cost-cutting rule will be applied to state contracts over five years of age, aimed at having these contracts tendered out as provided for in the Public Procurement Act, and in so doing achieve an additional savings of up to ISK 4 billion.\nIncreased digitisation improves efficiency in public institutions, giving them scope to economise in tandem with staff turnover. In this context, it can be pointed out that if half of the persons retiring in the next five years, excluding front-line staff, were not replaced the savings could amount to a cumulative saving of ISK 7 billion over the next five years. This will be explored further over the coming months.\nContinued advances in digital services are a prerequisite for achieving these goals, as those organizations that have progressed the furthest in digitization can now expect an increase in productivity of up to 50%.\nSuccessful results mean state support for electric vehicle imports can be reduced\nMajor success has been achieved in the electrification of the motor vehicle fleet and the supply of affordable cars has increased. In recent years, tax incentives have been granted for the purchase of eco-friendly cars. In the past year, this support has been reduced: firstly when the VAT concession for plug-in hybrid cars expired in May 2022 and, secondly, with a reduction in the amount of the VAT concession for fully clean energy cars at year-end 2022 from ISK 1,560,000 to ISK 1,320,000 per vehicle.\nThe total amount of VAT incentives on electric cars is expected to amount to ISK 10.2 billion in 2023. This amount will decrease considerably next year, but in order to continue supporting energy conversion projects, a total of ISK 7.5 billion will be provided to the Energy Fund (Orkusj\u00f3\u00f0ur) in 2024. This amount is expected to decrease again from 2026 onward to ISK 5 billion annually. It is emphasized that, although incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles will decrease, there will still be a financial incentive for households and companies to replace vehicles powered by fossil fuels due to lower operating costs.\nIn addition, the rate of VAT reimbursement for residential construction will be reduced from 60% to 35% from mid-2023, to dampen inflationary pressure.\nA new and stronger economy\nIn recent years the Icelandic economy has undergone a positive transformation, which is continuing at a rapid pace, not least due to new and vital pillars of the country's economy. \nUnprecedented investment has been directed to research and development and 2,000 new jobs have been created in hi-tech and industrial sectors in two years. Export earnings in intellectual property increased by 17% in nominal terms between 2020 and 2022, and the sector has significant growth potential. Major investments are in the pipeline in aquaculture and Icelandic fisheries is steadily advancing. Tourism has regained its previous level following the pandemic. Few societies are better placed to take advantage of the global climate and energy revolution.\n30 thousand jobs since the pandemic\nThe vitality in Icelandic society has resulted in better living standards than in most other countries. Unemployment is at a minimum, and strong growth has resulted in the creation of nearly 30,000 jobs from the lowest point during the COVID pandemic. \nPurchasing power generally has increased significantly, and the purchasing power of wages among the lowest-paid private-sector groups generally rose in 2022, despite higher inflation. Taxes have been reduced, salaries have increased significantly and social security benefits have been increased. The purchasing power of households' disposable income was ISK 200 billion higher in 2022 than in 2019 and never have more people bought their first home than in 2020 and 2021. Household defaults on loans have not been less than in 2022 since statistics on this have been gathered.\n\n\nPrioritising growth\nAccompanying the restraint in state operations will be prioritisation of further infrastructure improvement and value creation. As before, the focus is on taking advantage of growth in the economy and the sale of government assets to invest in a stronger society.\nThe biggest single project of the period is the construction of the new National University Hospital (NUH). The overall budget for the project, a total of ISK 211 billion, extends to 2030 and includes massive building construction as well as equipment and information technology. The overall plan provides for the construction of a new treatment centre and research laboratory to be completed in 2027.\nFurther development of NUH will be provided for in future fiscal plans for the years 2028-2030. This stage includes future arrangements for psychiatric services and the renovation of older buildings, along with other projects.\nSupport to improve the situation of low-income earners and protect people's livelihoods will be continued. Numerous measures have been implemented to that end in recent years, including a large reduction in income tax, increases in social security benefits, increases in housing and interest benefits as well as higher limits for reductions to benefits, almost doubling the earnings excluded from assessment for disability pensioners, and a special child benefit increase. In addition, efforts have been made to simplify and improve the child benefit system. During this Medium-term Fiscal Strategy plan period, an overall review will be made of the disability pension system, which will include greater emphasis on support earlier in the illness period than is currently the case, preventive measures in the labour market, and a review of the amounts of payment categories, with the aim of improving the situation of the least well off.\nA further billion to strengthen the university level\nInvestment will continue in opportunities for future growth. ISK 1 billion will be provided specifically to strengthen the university level in 2024, increasing in steps to ISK 2 billion before the end of the period, together with an additional allocation to vocational training at secondary school level, of up to ISK 600 million annually at the end of the period. Support for R&D will continue, and appropriations for innovative companies will increase by ISK 1.9. billion in 2024, with previously temporary funding sources made permanent. During the period a total of ISK 3 billion will be provided for additional research by the Marine Research Institute and a total of ISK 2.2 billion for expanded regulation of aquaculture, which is a steadily expanding sector. Finally, Iceland will continue its strong support for Ukraine, with ISK 750 million devoted to defence-related projects for Ukraine next year, as was the case this year.\nThe Medium-term Fiscal Strategy for 2024-2028 presents a clear vision: In the short term, reducing economic overheating and inflation, while safeguarding the living standards of the most vulnerable. In the longer term, to lay the foundation for further growth in Iceland on stronger economic pillars, greater opportunities, and improved living standards.\nFiscal Plan 2024-2028 - Appendix tables", "id": "3d4eddbba8f93fbe90e1664b470010c5"}

It seems that the virus will be a part of our existence for months to come, and maybe even for years. Now, we must figure out a way to continue our daily life with sensible modifications and precautions. We also need to shift out of crisis-mode and replace that with ongoing vigilance. Personal responsibility needs to become a norm in order for us to avoid serious setbacks, and we will continue to use early detection, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, to minimize the risk to our population.\"\nIceland's efforts to minimize the risk of new COVID-19 outbreaks have been effective since the initial outbreak subsided in late April. A total of 1 841 people have been diagnosed with the disease since the first case was detected on 28 February. Of those 1 823 have recovered, 8 are isolated with a mild infection, and 10 have died. \nSince 15 June, travellers entering Iceland from high-risk areas have been offered a choice between a 14-day quarantine or a PCR test for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (that causes COVID-19). This measure is intended to minimise the risk of the virus entering undetected into the country.\nCurrently, all countries, except Denmark, the Faeroe Islands, Finland, Germany, Greenland, and Norway are classified as high-risk areas by the Chief Epidemiologist. A further review of this classification is expected at the end of the month.\nIf a sample shows the presence of the virus, a test for the seroprevalence of antibodies is performed. A person who has developed antibodies is considered to have recovered from the illness, despite minuscule traces of the virus still being detectable in the body. A person with a prior infection poses no risk of further spreading the virus and can safely enter the community. If no antibodies are found, the infected person must self-isolate and those who have been exposed to a potential infection must be quarantined.\nSince 15 June, a total of 50 290 tests have been performed at the border. Of those, 113 (0,22%) have shown the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Upon testing for the seroprevalence of antibodies, 93 positive tests (82%) have proven to be from prior infection, and 20 are indicative of an active infection. \nThis week, reporting has been updated to more accurately reflect the current situation in Iceland. Previously, all positive PCR tests at the border were counted as new cases and figured into the total case count for COVID-19 in Iceland, including individuals who had already recovered at the time of arrival. With the very low prevalence of the disease in Iceland, these erroneously reported cases had a significant skewing effect on international comparison. Currently, the incidence of Covid-19 in the past 14 days is 2,2 per 100 thousand inhabitants, with a total of 8 infections having been found at the border and no local cases reported.\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has updated its reporting to reflect this change.

{"date": "April 28, 2023", "title": "Updated Sovereign Sustainable Financing Framework and an Annex on Financing for Gender Equality", "content": "The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs has issued an updated Sovereign Sustainable Financing Framework, but the original framework was issued in September 2021. The update consists of minor adjustments to ensure that the framework is in accordance with the most recent international guidelines. In addition to the update, an annex to the framework on financing for gender equality has been issued. This enables the Government to issue sustainable, green, blue, social and/or gender bonds in Iceland and abroad.\nThe creation of the Annex on Financing for Gender Equality reflects the Government\u2019s strong commitment to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment and ambition to be at the forefront when it comes to leveraging the tools of public finance and capital markets in that regard. The work on this Annex was led by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs with participation of other ministries and governmental agencies, as well as consultation with UN Women\u2019s technical expertise.\nThe market for sustainable bonds has grown immensely in the last decade and the diversity has increased. As with all sustainable financing instruments, there is a growing interest in investment opportunities that contribute to gender equality, but so far, no sovereign has issued designated gender bonds.\nBjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs:\n\u201cThe update of the financing framework is an important step towards sustainable bonds issuance, but we see an increased demand for such bonds. A special gender annex is an exciting addition. We are, and intend to continue to be, at the forefront internationally when it comes to gender equality. Here we are mobilizing financial markets and public finance in this regard.\u201d\nBonds issued under this sustainable financing framework and annex provide funding for certain defined Treasury expenditures, which fall into four categories:\n\nGreen projects (climate and environmental issues), such as energy transition of vehicles and infrastructure, infrastructure for bicycles and electric bicycles, green buildings, natural disaster preventions, adaptation to the circular economy, forestry, wetland reclamation etc.\nBlue projects (climate and environmental issues relating to the ocean, seafood, and related sectors), such as electrification of harbours, energy transition for ships and ferries, a sewage treatment initiative, etc.\nSocial projects, such as social housing, patient care, support to people with limited work capacity and actions to reduce drop-out rates from schools, etc.\n\nGender projects, redistribution of women\u2019s unpaid care with investment in the care economy, essential social and economic support to women in vulnerable positions, services and programs to prevent, respond to and prosecute sexual and gender-based violence, entrepreneurial support and grant programs for underrepresented groups, etc.\nAll project categories are considered to promote one or more sustainable development goals (SDGs) and together they cover all 17 SDGs, making this a comprehensive sustainable financing framework.\n\nThe framework and the annex have received a second party opinion from CICERO Shades of Green, which is now a part of S&P Global. CICERO rates the blue and green bond issuance under the framework as Dark Green. The score indicates that the projects to be financed support the long-term vision of a low-carbon future and climate resilient future. The social and gender bond issuance are not graded on a similar scale as the green and blue categories but get a positive review. In CICERO\u2019s opinion the eligible social projects credibly aim to support the existing social infrastructure in Iceland, and the gender categories support interventions that address some of the most pressing shortcomings identified by studies.\n\nIcelands Sovereign Sustainable Framework\nAnnex to Icelands's Sovereign Sustainable Financing Framework: Financing for Gender Equality\u00a0\nGovernment of Iceland Sustainable Financing Framework Second Opinion", "id": "40e2710067af3a959af6cbe97647848a"}

{"date": "June 29, 2021", "title": "Treasury outcome affected by the pandemic", "content": "The results of the Government accounts for 2020 have now been published and the accounts sent to Parliament. According to the accounts, the outcome was negative by ISK 144bn, as compared with a surplus of ISK 42bn in 2019. Revenues totalled ISK 802bn and operating expenditures ISK 990bn. Net financial expense totalled ISK -46bn, and the share in earnings of Government-owned companies was ISK 90bn.\nIn spring 2020, all of the key premises for economic and fiscal planning were shattered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. By that time, the economic expansion accompanying the rapid growth of tourism had already begun to ease. Tourist numbers had fallen, partly because of airline WOW Air\u2019s reduced operations and subsequent collapse. Reduced economic activity quickly showed in a deterioration in the Treasury outcome. Nevertheless, the outlook was for the economy to regain its momentum at the beginning of the year. But as 2020 progressed, it grew clear that Iceland, like the rest of the world, was facing a deep economic crisis.\u00a0\nFrom the outset, the Government was determined to apply fiscal policy aggressively so as to support the economy, preserve jobs, protect households\u2019 financial position, and create the resilience needed for value creation in the wake of the crisis. Wielding fiscal strength in this manner helped to mitigate the economic contraction and dilute its impact on households and businesses. In part because of this strong response, domestic demand contracted by only 2% and households\u2019 disposable income increased in 2020.\u00a0\n\u201cBecause of the Treasury\u2019s strong position, we did not need to cut public services, and transfer systems were safeguarded despite the steep drop in revenues. As a consequence, basic Government services were preserved at a time when broad-based economic measures were adopted in response to the impact of the pandemic, with the aim of protecting household incomes and providing shelter and resilience to firms. Extensive infrastructure investment was undertaken and spending on research and development was increased substantially, in order to stimulate economic activity and create the conditions for a robust post-pandemic recovery. The effects of these conditions and these necessary actions can be seen clearly in the 2020 Government accounts,\u201d said Bjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, about the accounts.\u00a0\nRevenues in 2020\n\nRevenues excluding financial income contracted by ISK 28bn year-on-year, to a total of ISK 802bn. Of that total, taxes, payroll taxes, and other Government revenues declined by ISK 29bn, while revenues from operations increased by ISK 1bn. Most tax revenue items showed a contraction, particularly value-added tax and investment tax. Payroll taxes also contracted, as did investment income, fines, and various other revenues. When the outcome is adjusted to the budgetary presentation, which is based on the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) standard, it can be seen that revenues from taxes and payroll taxes were ISK 76bn below the original budgetary estimate. Nevertheless, the outcome is more favourable than the last updated estimates indicated. Overall, it is ISK 13bn above the year-end estimate.\nOutcome for 2020\n\nThe outcome for the year was negative by ISK 144bn, whereas it was positive by ISK 42bn in 2019. Expenditures before financial items totalled ISK 990bn, an increase of ISK 181bn year-on-year. The rise stems mainly from increased expenditures due to unemployment and support measures for businesses, in the amount of ISK 81bn. Other pandemic-related expenditures came to ISK 35bn. In addition, State pension obligations increased by ISK 33bn year-on-year as a result of negotiated wage agreements.\u00a0\nAt year-end 2020, assets totalled ISK 2,613bn, an increase of ISK 258bn year-on-year. Cash and cash equivalents increased by ISK 108bn year-on-year, and shares in companies increased by ISK 106bn, including ISK 70bn due to the Central Bank of Iceland. Fixed assets increased by ISK 30bn, mostly because of investments in transport infrastructure. Equity totalled ISK 238bn, a decline of ISK 124bn from the prior year. Long-term liabilities increased by ISK 143bn and short-term liabilities by ISK 215bn. Cash from operations was negative by ISK 110bn, after contracting by ISK 164bn. At the year-end, cash and cash equivalents totalled ISK 378bn, an increase of ISK 108bn. Financing activities were positive by ISK 266bn, as compared with ISK 27bn in 2019.\nTreasury outcome for 2020 better than previously expected\n\nIt should be noted that the operating results in the Government accounts are published on the basis of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), whereas the overall outcome in the fiscal plan and the fiscal budget is presented according to the GFS standard. Both methods are intended to ensure consistency and international comparability. In order to compare the Treasury performance according to the Government accounts with the performance targets in the fiscal plan and the fiscal budget, it is therefore necessary to adjust the outcome of the Government accounts to the GFS. On this basis, it was assumed in the 2020 fiscal budget that the overall outcome would be negative by ISK 10bn. The outcome for the year turned out negative by ISK 218bn, however, owing almost entirely to the impact of the pandemic. It should be noted, however, that according to the last estimates prepared during the year, the outcome was expected to be poorer by an additional ISK 50bn. The fact that the outcome turned out better than was feared at one time is due in part to successful economic measures, which greatly mitigated both the economic contraction and the impact on the Treasury.\u00a0\nFoundations for a strong recovery\n\nThe adverse impact of the 2020 results is nevertheless significant and will make its mark on the Treasury outcome and debt position in coming years. It is therefore important to bear in mind the guiding principle behind the Government\u2019s responses and measures: to address the repercussions of the pandemic decisively, but without shunting the cost to future generations. This strong response has enabled the authorities to minimise pandemic-related losses and lay the foundations for a robust recovery when the pandemic has passed.\u00a0\n\nNew, accessible website\n\nConcurrent with the publication of the Government accounts, a new website focusing on Government finances and human resources information is being launched: rikisreikningur.is. The site is an update of the previous website, and the plan is to publish a range of information on Government operations and human resources, with the aim of simplifying the general public\u2019s access to this information. The website contains highlights from the Government accounts, as well as more detailed analysis of specific topics. Information on Government finances by function, type, ministry, and Government entity can be found there. Also available are various key figures, including those relating to human resources; i.e., summaries of Government staffing numbers and full-time position equivalents.", "id": "4268cea601a23aff89175e0091f43f68"}

The amendments entailed in the Act were announced in a\u00a0press release posted on the Central Bank website on 7 December 2018, when the bill of legislation was introduced. The Act will enter into force tomorrow, 5 March 2019.\nAmendments to Rules\n\nBecause of amendments to the Foreign Exchange Act and the Act on Special Reserve Requirements for New Foreign Currency Inflows, the Central Bank plans to set new Rules on Special Reserve Requirements for New Foreign Currency Inflows and Rules on the Treatment of Kr\u00f3na-Denominated Assets Subject to Special Restrictions. The Rules include new provisions and necessary amendments due to the aforementioned amending legislation. The new Rules on Special Reserve Requirements for New Foreign Currency Inflows will also lower the special reserve ratio (SRR) provided for the previous rules from 20% to 0%. It is assumed that, pending Ministerial approval, the rules will be issued tomorrow, 5 March 2019, and will take effect the day after, 6 March 2019.\nReduction of special reserve ratio from 20% to 0%\n\nThe planned reduction in the special reserve ratio marks a turning point in the application of the SRR, which was imposed on capital inflows into the bond market and high-yielding deposits in June 2016. The objective of the SRR is to temper and affect the composition of foreign capital inflows into the domestic bond market and high-yielding deposits, and to strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The SRR was lowered from 40% to 20% in early November 2018. Conditions have now developed that permit lowering the SRR to 0%, because the likelihood of substantial inflows leading to an overshooting of the exchange rate and to severe disturbances in the monetary policy transmission mechanism has subsided significantly, at least for the present. Capital flows to and from Iceland are now better balanced than they were at the time the SRR was introduced. In the recent past, there have been outflows of new foreign investments in bonds.\u00a0\nIt should be noted that because of the above-specified amendments, funds that have been tied up in special reserve accounts will be available for withdrawal or other disposition, in the same manner as when the SRR was reduced from 40% to 20% in November. It should also be noted that if the SRR is increased in the future, the newly passed legislation states unequivocally that the special reserve amount shall remain unchanged throughout the holding period. The new arrangements for the SRR will enable the parties involved to release their funds through market transactions, however.\nLegacy issues relating to the capital controls\nWith the above-mentioned amendments to the Foreign Exchange Act and the Act on the Treatment of Kr\u00f3na-Denominated Assets Subject to Special Restrictions, a separate offshore market for kr\u00f3nur no longer exists and the vast majority of the capital controls introduced in November 2008 have been lifted. The restrictions that remain have the primary objective of ensuring that the SRR achieves its purpose, including restrictions on derivatives trading for non-hedging purposes. Those restrictions will be examined in connection with a comprehensive review of the Foreign Exchange Act. At the same time, it will be necessary to examine the permanent arrangements for the SRR.", "id": "44dc90813f713a00b7cbd33561b9d655"}

The report is a follow up on that call and a contribution from the Nordic countries for an informative global discussion on a new agreement.\n\nMismanaged plastic waste ending up in the environment and oceans is a growing environmental challenge of global concerns. Large quantities of plastics are found in our oceans, air, soil and freshwater resources and pose a severe threat to the marine ecosystem. \n\nThe report suggests an approach to a new global agreement that aims to engage governments, industry and consumers in a joint effort to prevent plastics pollution. The report introduces national plastic\u2019s management plans as a core commitment of governments in a possible agreement. Sustainability criteria for plastic products across the entire life-cycle is another feature in the report. \n\nThe Minister for the Environment and Natural Resources, Gu\u00f0mundur Ingi Gu\u00f0brandsson, said that Iceland already has made a National plan on how to manage and prevent plastic pollution. He underlined that such plans are an important feature of a global agreement. \u201cPlastic pollution does not respect borders. That is why this is an international task, like most other environmental challenges. Such issues need to be dealt with by global agreements and strong actions in each country. Our task now is to reach consensus on a new global agreement and the report is most helpful in outlining the elements of such an agreement. This is not a question of if or when, but how.

The new measures are to help Iceland meet its Paris Agreement targets for 2030 and reach the government\u2018s ambitious aim to make Iceland carbon neutral before 2040. \nThe Climate Strategy was launched by Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir at a press conference, flanked by 6 other Ministers in her Government. The Strategy consists of 34 Government measures, ranging from an increase in reforestation to a ban on new registration of fossil fuel cars by 2030. The plan aims at transforming the transportation system from using imported fossil fuels to a carbon-free system run on renewable energy. The plan will be subject to public consultation, and an updated Strategy will be published in 2019, taking into account comments and suggestions by civil society. \n\u201eThe Government has secured substantial increase in funding for climate mitigation measures, and now presents a new climate strategy, with clearly defined priorities. Ahead is a period of consultation with industry, municipalities and civil society on how to implement the strategy and individual actions. We have a clear determination to succeed in our goals in this most important issue; to reach our Paris Agreement goals by 2030 and the Government\u2019s stated aim for a carbon neutral Iceland by 2040,\u201c said Prime Minister Jakobsd\u00f3ttir. \nThe main emphasis of the new plan is on two measures: 1) to phase out fossil fuels in transport, and 2) to increase carbon sequestration in land use, by afforestation, revegetation and restoration of wetlands. Climate mitigation measures will get a substantial increase in funding \u2013 almost 7 billion Icelandic kr\u00f3nur in the period 2019-2023. A general carbon tax, already in place, will be gradually increased.\nIceland already enjoys virtually carbon-free electricity and heating, thanks to its utilization of geothermal and hydro energy. Fossil fuels are used in transport and fisheries, and now the aim is set for a push in decarbonizing those sectors. Among the measures announces in the new plan are: increases in government support for charging stations and other infrastructure for electrical transport and other clean fuels; support for biofuel production; a strengthening of already generous subsidies for electrical cars and other clean vehicles; and support for public transport and bicycling. Iceland has seen a considerable increase in the purchase of electrical cars recently, and the plan aims at greatly accelerating this trend in the coming years.\nAfforestation and revegetation have long been a major emphasis in Iceland\u2018s climate policies, as these actions help to mitigate climate change by uptake of carbon from the atmosphere. Funding for these activities will be increased. The Government will also support efforts to reclaim drained wetlands, which in recent years have been shown to be a significant source of carbon emissions.\nThe package of actions also includes such measures as: The launching of a new fund to support low-carbon technology; a phase-out for landfilling organic waste; a phase-out programme for climate-warming chemicals known as HFCs; participation in emissions trading for industry and aviation and other sectors; public education campaigns, and other measures.", "id": "4920cc8b43b63a2c84a754da7a814f2e"}

This decision is taken in keeping with the EU\u2019s decision to initiate the same kind of action, as provided for in Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons. The reception of refugees in Iceland will cover the same defined groups as determined by the EU. This method is first and foremost intended to make it possible to aid those who flee from Ukraine swiftly and effectively, namely by granting them temporary protection, without the reception and aid overwhelming Iceland\u2019s protection system.\n\nThe UN Refugee Agency has issued notifications on the mass flight from Ukraine and has estimated that up to 4 million people will flee the conflict in the coming days and weeks. The Ministry of Justice has worked closely with the Schengen member states, including in preparation for the pending activation of Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons.\n\nArticle 44 states that \u201cA foreign national who is a member of a group which flees a specified region and arrives in Iceland, or is in Iceland when the provisions of the article are applied, may upon application for international protection be granted protection on the basis of a group assessment\u201d, i.e. collective protection. This means that foreign nationals will be granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under Article 74 of the Foreign Nationals Act No 80/2016.\n\nSuch a residence permit is issued for one year at a time, with the possibility to renew or extend it for up to three years from the time a permit was first issued. After that time, a permit may be issued under Article 74 that can become the basis for a permanent residence permit. One year after such a permit is issued, i.e. the fourth year from the issuance of the first permit, a permanent residence permit may be issued, provided that conditions for holding the permit still exist and other requirements are met.\n\nAccess to services\n\nA residence permit granted to individuals on these grounds entails the same rights and access to services as a residence permit on humanitarian grounds, in keeping with Article 74 of the Foreign Nationals Act. It entails access to housing, maintenance, social services, health care services and access to the labour market. These rights are, for the most part, the same as those that individuals will receive in other European countries on the basis of Directive 2001/55/EC.\n\nRight to employment\n\nUnder the current Foreign Nationals\u2019 Right to Work Act, No 97/2002, those who receive a residence permit on humanitarian grounds only receive conditional access to the Icelandic labour market, which is based on the requirement that an employer must apply for a work permit for the person in question. Ukrainian refugees will therefore have access to the Icelandic labour market. A Bill of Amendment to the Foreign Nationals Act, which is now being prepared by the Ministry of Justice, proposes to amend these provisions of the Foreign Nationals\u2019 Right to Work Act so that all persons who receive a residence permit on humanitarian grounds will receive a work permit along with the residence permit, automatically and without intermediaries.", "id": "4a4d6e62cd6a3e4ea7ff6df3fc30f11e"}

Support which allows workers to go part-time and receive top up payments from the government will be extended until the autumn, with amendments, and simpler rules on financial restructuring of businesses will be adopted enabling firms to seek protection easily.\nThe Government has approved three proposals in support of employees and companies. The aim of the proposals is to mitigate the damage caused by mass lay-offs and mass insolvencies, thereby protecting workers\u2019 rights while fostering greater resilience in the economy as a whole.\n\nThe option for full time workers to move to part-time with government support will be extended to 31 August, from its original finish date on 1 June. The livelihoods of tens of thousands of employees have been protected since this support measure took effect, but the economic outlook has changed markedly in the month or so. The part-time option allows employees to reduce their hours or salary to as low as 25%, or 50% from July onwards, and top up their earnings with support from the Government. An application must be filed for an extension, and the requirements for participation will be reviewed.\u00a0\n\n\nSimpler rules on financial restructuring of companies will be temporarily put in place. The new rules will incorporate the basic elements of the current rules, with amendments aimed to simplify the process of seeking protection for companies while an assessment is made of their position, and until the outlook for the future is clarified. The amendments cover factors such as the requirements for financial restructuring, requests for restructuring and consideration of applications, deadlines, authorisations for measures, counterparties\u2019 authorisations for cancellation, and non-performance clauses.\n\n\nIn order to protect workers\u2019 rights and avoid insolvencies, companies will be given the opportunity to apply for government support to pay a portion of salary costs for any staff member during their notice period. This support will take the form of payment up to ISK 633,000 per month for up to three months, plus vacation pay. It is limited to those companies that have suffered at least a 75% loss in revenue and are forecasting continued revenue losses at least through 2020. An estimated quarter of Icelandic companies are anticipated to be eligible for this support.Government support will be capped at a ratio of 85%. These employees will have priority access to jobs when business activities resume, and will retain certain specified accrued rights from that employer.

The Committee sent its proposal to the Ministries of Social Affairs, Justice, and Foreign Affairs.\nThe Refugee Committee proposes giving support to families living in Iceland that have the right to family reunification with family members in Afghanistan. A focus will also be put on assisting individuals who are in imminent danger due to their work in Afghanistan, whether it be for NATO or in the field of gender equality. The government\u2019s first response and action in keeping with the Refugee Committee\u2019s proposals will be as follows:\n\nReceiving employees who worked with and for NATO, along with their spouses and children. This will especially include those who worked with the Iceland Crisis Response Unit. \u00a0\nAfghanis who are former students of the United Nations Gender Equality Studies Training Programme in Iceland will be invited to come to Iceland along with their spouses and children.\nThe Icelandic government will assist those Afghanis who have the right to family reunification or who have already received an Icelandic residence permit but who are unable to travel independently to Iceland. They include individuals who have family relationships in Iceland, as well as individuals who intend to study here.\nApplications made for family reunification with Afghanis residing in Iceland, in accordance with the Foreign Nationals Act, will be given priority and budget resources will be increased in order to speed up the application process.\n\nThe final number of people who will be received is not currently known, but it is expected to be as many as 120 people. It is hard to estimate the exact number, since it depends on the composition of the families. Up to now, Iceland has received quota refugees from Afghanistan in cooperation with the UN Refugee Agency, and will continue to do so, but in light of the current emergency situation in Afghanistan it is important for the Icelandic government to make their contribution immediately.\nThe Refugee Committee also proposes that an action group be set up to elaborate the implementation of the proposals, since this will be quite complicated because it entails transporting these people to Iceland, ensuring their safety and making sure they receive the assistance they will need upon arrival. The Refugee Committee is composed of representatives of the Ministers of Social Affairs and Children, Justice, and Foreign Affairs and International Development Cooperation.

{"date": "April 09, 2020", "title": "Covid-19 epidemic receding in Iceland - 295 new infections in the past seven days and 363 recoveries", "content": "Iceland's Chief Epidemiologists said in yesterday's press briefing that the data suggests that the outbreak of Covid-19 in Iceland is showing clear signs of deceleration. He advises that the apparent success is precarious, and minor setbacks can change the outlook dramatically. \"We anticipate being able to slowly ease the social distancing measure we have put in place, but we will have to continue to exercise extreme caution in the foreseeable future in order to minimize the risk of a renewed outbreak,\u201c says Mr Thorolfur Gudnason, Chief Epidemiologist.\n\nFurthermore, it is assumed that despite the peak in active infections having been reached, it is likely that we are still a few days from the peak in hospitalizations. \"Our healthcare workers and hospitals have shown admirable foresight and perseverance in the fight against Covid-19. We are now bracing ourselves for the period of peak intensity in terms of the need for intensive care possible and ventilator support,\" says Alma M\u00f6ller, Iceland's Surgeon General.\n\nIceland's strategy has been based on:\n\nsocial distancing measures, focused on vulnerable populations first and then society at-large,\na very high level of testing, in collaboration with deCode Genetics,\ndiligent tracing efforts of each known infection\na policy of self-quarantining for individuals considered at-risk of having been infected\ninnovative treatment and monitoring options with an emphasis on remote care.\n\n\nIt needs to be emphasized that the situation in Iceland is unusual in many ways. The population is small, cohesive and mostly homogenous. \"We are an island with one major point of entry from abroad. Many other peculiarities make Iceland\u2019s position different from most other nations. That being said, we have a very sincere hope that our efforts, both in terms of policy and data generation will prove to be valuable for academics and policy makers in the future. The world is all in this together and it is vital that every country draws learnings both internally and externally to improve our readiness for any similar events in the future, or the continuation of this event in the upcoming months and years,\" says Thorolfur Gudnason, Chief Epidemiologist.\nHigh number of tests\nThe number of infections detected in Iceland so far is 1 616. This is a very high number of infections in relation to its small population (4 489 on a per million basis). This high number is largely attributable to the fact that significantly more testing has been done in Iceland than in any other country (except for the Faroe Islands). On a per million basis the total number of tests performed is over 85 thousand (the corresponding number for Germany is approximately 11 thousand and 9 500 for South Korea).\nThe testing in Iceland has been done on two different cohorts.\nOn the one hand by the National University Hospital of Iceland. These tests (12 777) have been mostly on individuals who were symptomatic or were likely to have contracted the virus due to proximity to infected individuals or other reasons. A total of 11 303 of those samples have been negative and 1 474 have been positive. In recent days, the percentage of positive tests in this cohort has dropped markedly.\nOn the other hand, a total of 18 170 tests have been performed by deCode Genetics on the general population, mostly individuals who had not been ordered to quarantine and were generally asymptomatic or showed mild cold- or flu-like symptoms. Out of these tests 18 028 have been negative and 142 have been positive. In the past two days, a total of 2 161 samples taken among the general population have yielded 2 positives (0,09%).\nFocus on protecting vulnerable groups\nSix individuals with Covid-19 infections have died in Iceland during the outbreak. So far, a low number of infections among the elderly population has contributed to a low fatality rate. Out of the 977 infections that are active, 54 are in individuals over the age of 70 (5,2%), the group considered to be the most at-risk of serious outcomes. \nEffective efforts to minimize infection risks at hospitals and nursing homes have proven to be instrumental in limiting the damage caused by the outbreak so far.\nEffective tracing and quarantining\nMore than half (53%) of cases identified are individuals who had already been directed to self-quarantined. This gives an indication of the success of the tracing and quarantining effort so far. A specialized team of tracers has been able to successfully trace more than 92% of cases.\nLast week, a newly developed app was released for smartphones. As of midnight 7 April, over 120 thousand people had downloaded the app. The app stores locally on the user's device location data. In case an individual becomes infected the data can be shared with the authorities. The decision to share the data is discretionary for each user and the decision to download the app is voluntary. While the app is a very recent addition to the tracing efforts, it is expected to make the work of the tracing team easier in the future.\nEmphasis on remote care\nThroughout the epidemic a focus has been placed on remote care and consultation through phone and online chat. This has been a core part of our efforts to protect the hospitals and healthcare clinics from being overburdened, and it has also been an important part of our effort to limit infection risk.\nAn Icelandic digital therapeutics company, Sidekick Health, developed a platform to remotely monitor, assess and advise patients through its existing software. The platform is now used by the Icelandic healthcare system in conjunction with other remote-care solutions. \"By increasing the effectiveness of remote care, we can help save lives, focus healthcare resources and minimize the risk of overburdening hospitals,\" says Tryggvi Thorgeirsson, MD and CEO of Sidekick Health.\nFor further information, please contact Mar\u00eda Mj\u00f6ll J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir ([email\u00a0protected]).", "id": "4faa8a0772c13d5ea806b4009d77f8b8"}

The score indicates that the projects to be financed support the long-term vision of a low-carbon future and climate resilient future. For its social projects, CICERO gave a positive commentary. The framework enables the Government to finance its activities, including by issuing sustainable, green, blue, and/or social bonds in Iceland and abroad.\nBjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs:\nIt is extremely gratifying to see this goal become a reality. We have long had our eye on opportunities for sustainable bond issues, and investors\u2019 interest has grown year by year. An important factor is that the terms on such issues are becoming more and more favourable, and it is highly likely that sustainable financing will be not only a hallmark of quality for our fiscal policy, but also a way for us to enjoy favourable terms for a strong performance, including on climate issues. This is a welcome development and a true watershed.\nThe interest of issuers and investors for sustainable financing has grown rapidly all over the world in the past decade. There has been a widespread awakening in the financial industry and the general public about the relationship of finance and the climate, environment, and social challenges. This has been reflected in rapidly growing interest in sustainable financing and investments. Bonds issued under this sustainable financing framework provide funding for certain defined Treasury expenditures, which fall into three categories:\n\n\u00a0Green projects (climate and environmental issues), such as infrastructure for bicycles and electric bicycles, the energy transition of vehicles and infrastructure, green buildings, natural disaster preventions, adaptation to the circular economy, wetland reclamation, etc.\nBlue projects (climate and environmental issues relating to the ocean, seafood, and related sectors), such as electrification of harbours, energy transition for ships and ferries, a sewage treatment initiative, etc.\n\u00a0Social projects, such as social housing, patient care, job creation including COVID-related expenditures in support of society and the economy, etc.\n\nThe Government has set clear objectives for sustainability and has taken on international commitments concerning climate action, as well as signing a memorandum of understanding on sustainable development with the financial system. The objective of the climate action plan is to ensure that Iceland meets both the targets under the Paris Agreement and its own ambitious target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.\nOne facet of the Government\u2019s climate action plan is sustainable financing, which entails exploring the feasibility of sustainable financing and broadening the group of investors for its conventional borrowings. The Treasury\u2019s increased need for credit in the coming years provides an opportunity to obtain sustainable financing without compromising debt management objectives concerning a deep, active market, and regular issuance.\nIn 2020, the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs appointed a work group to explore the possibilities for sustainable Treasury financing. Among the group\u2019s tasks was to define and create this sustainable financing framework. The Framework, which is based on international standards and benchmarks, has received a CICERO Dark Green rating, the highest possible, for the green and blue projects to be financed. The social projects have received positive commentary, and the governance practices for sustainable financing received a \u201cgood\u201d rating.The opinion and commentary from CICERO \u2013 Shades of Green reflect the Government\u2019s ambitious long-term environmental and climate objectives, as well as the hard work and progressive thinking invested in the preparation of the framework.\nOther countries that have received opinions from CICERO Shades of Green are: Indonesia (medium green), Kenya (medium green), Hungary (medium green), and Sweden (dark green).\n\nIceland\u2019s Sovereign Sustainable Financing Framework\u00a0\nThe opinion from CICERO \u2013 Shades of Green", "id": "4fb50c66cdf63fdbafa6703df7519b77"}

The output gap has contracted and the likelihood of a downturn in the tourism sector has increased. The financial cycle upswing continues and for the seventh quarter in a row there is growth in nominal private debt. High real estate prices, both for residential and commercial real estate, poses significant risk. The development in the residential housing market is partially due to the rapid growth of the tourism sector in recent years. Icelandic flight operators have faced some headwinds in the past months. Possible shocks to the sector would not threaten financial stability. The current account surplus has diminished rapidly but the financial position of households and businesses remains robust. The banks\u2019 capital ratios have declined, partly due to dividend payments but they are still well above their capital requirements and their liquidity position also above the Central Bank\u2019s requirements. The banks\u2019 resilience is therefore considerable. The economy is robust against shocks, i.a. due to a favorable external position, a large foreign exchange reserve and historically low indebtedness of the public and private sectors.\nThe Council approved a policy on the application of the countercyclical buffer and recommendations to the Financial Supervisory Authority on maintaining the same countercyclical buffer.", "id": "549afa13c1d33c82a28be5ceff8ec8c4"}

These measures will enter into force at midnight. The common restrictions on numbers will be 50 persons, but events with up to 500 participants in each disease prevention compartment may be held if rapid tests are used. The opening hours of restaurants will be shortened by one hour. The maximum number of visitors allowed at public swimming pools, spas, gyms and ski areas will be 75% of their maximum allowed capacity as stated in their operating licences. The regulation on these measures will remain in force through 8 December.\n\nThe main reason for these stricter measures is the sharp rise in infections in the country and the resulting growing strain on the health-care system, contact tracing team and quarantine centres. The situation has caused a considerable disruption to various services at the National University Hospital, as well as a lack of staff. The Chief Epidemiologist\u2019s memorandum to the Minister states that the Akureyri Hospital is under growing strain and the same applies to many other health care institutions. The contact tracing team\u2019s activities have been disrupted, quarantine centres are filling up fast and the strain on the Medical Hotline and health care clinics has increased because of the pandemic. The Chief Epidemiologist says that strict disease-prevention measures are necessary while efforts are underway to reach widespread immunity through society through the booster vaccinations that have already started. The plan is to invite around 160,000 people all over the country to receive booster vaccinations before the end of the year.\nRestrictions to take place at midnight, 13 November:\n\nThe general restriction on numbers will be 50 persons: That number does not include children born in 2016 and after. This means that no more than 50 persons are allowed to gather, neither indoors nor outdoors, in neither public nor private spaces.\u00a0\nSocial distancing between strangers will be 1 metre: Face masks must be used if this distancing can not be respected. However, sports involving physical contact will continue to be allowed for both children and adults. Pre-school children and pupils in elementary school grades 1 through 4 will be exempt from the 1 metre rule. \nUse of face masks: The use of face masks is required if the 1 metre rule can not be respected, e.g. in shops, on public transport and in activities that require close proximity, e.g. in hair salons. Children born in 2006 and after will be exempt from using face masks.\u00a0\nLarge gatherings allowed subject to using rapid tests: Events with up to 500 persons in each disease prevention compartment may be held if all visitors born before 2015 can present a negative result from a rapid test that must be no older than 48 hours. If the 1 metre rule can not be respected, all guests shall wear face masks, with the exception of children born in 2006 and after. The 1 metre rule can be waived for sit-down events, in which case face masks must be worn. Guests in allocated seats must be registered by name, personal identification number and telephone number. Refreshments may not be sold during intermissions. School entertainment events in primary and secondary schools where rapid tests are used are exempt from the 1 metre rule and face mask requirement.\nSwimming pools, spas, gyms and ski areas may receive up to 75% of their maximum capacity according to the conditions of their operating licence. That number does not include children born in 2016 and after.\nOpening hours of restaurants, etc. Restaurants and other venues that are permitted to serve alcohol are forbidden to receive customers after 22.00 h (10 p.m.) and all customers must have left the venue by 23.00 h (11 p.m.). Alcoholic beverages may only be served to seated customers. All customers must be registered. Private gatherings in venues that are permitted to serve alcohol must end no later than 23.00 h (11 p.m.).\u00a0\nShops and museums: The general 50 person restriction, 1 metre rule and face mask requirement apply to shops and museums. However, 5 extra customers may be received per each 10 m2, however no more than up to a total of 500 persons.\n\nSchool activities:\n\nThe general 50 person restriction applies to school activities, except for children born in 2016 and after. Children born in 2006 and after will be exempt from using face masks. \nPre-school staff members are not required to wear face masks when interacting with pre-school children.\nElementary school teachers are permitted to remove their face masks after the children have sat down in their classrooms.\nUpper secondary school students and teachers are permitted to remove their face masks after they have sat down in their classrooms.\nMixing between school groups is permitted at all school levels.\n\n\nCOVID-19: Zaostrzone \u015brodki, ograniczenie zgromadze\u0144 do 50 os\u00f3b \u2013 nacisk na szczepienia przypominaj\u0105ce", "id": "575b0c0ff8c53029856475c30865d684"}

In its findings, the task force emphasises that each monetary policy framework has its advantages and disadvantages.

The foundations for monetary policy should be strengthened with more targeted use of macroprudential policy, so that the Central Bank of Iceland will be solely responsible for financial stability in the same way as it is now solely responsible for price stability.

It is important to share experiences of how prioritizing gender equality strengthens our societies. In Iceland, progressive policies towards gender equality are the foundation for an inclusive, prosperous society where people of all genders can prosper.\nWe have come a long way since Beijing, yet we are aware of the numerous remaining challenges to fully close the gender gap. In many areas, progress is unacceptably slow and there have been increased efforts to roll back previous victories on women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights and freedoms. We are concerned about the increased politicisation of women\u2019s human rights - and are committed to defending them. \nIt is also disappointing to see that five years after the adoption of the 2030 agenda, it is goal number five, ensuring gender equality, that most countries are furthest from reaching. \nWe must and we can do better.\nThe gendered impact of COVID-19 is abundantly clear. As a result of the pandemic, we see conditions where those who seek to curtail women\u2019s rights have been enabled. We see an increase in existing inequalities, an alarming rise in gender-based violence and a sharp increase in extreme poverty among women. \u00a0As we begin the enormous task of rebuilding and reimagining our societies after the pandemic, it is essential we keep issues of gender equality, racial equality, democracy and social justice at the forefront in all our efforts.\nWe commend UN Women for initiating the ambitious Generation Equality Forum and Iceland is honored to take a leadership role in the Action Coalition on Gender-Based Violence. As the MeToo movement so clearly exposed, violence against women has not been eliminated. \nOur goal must be a sustainable future where women and girls from all social backgrounds and all parts of the world have access to education and health services. Where they have equal opportunities to work, are ensured equal pay, where they are free from the threat of sexual and gender-based violence.\nWe owe this to our previous generations who fought for the legal recognition of gender equality.

The Minister of Health has decided to take these measures in keeping with the recommendation of the Chief Epidemiologist, who has expressed concern over the rapid increase in infections, the increase in serious illness and the growing strain on the health care system.

The revised policy targets entail a reduction in the planned general government surplus, in view of the changed economic outlook as portrayed in recent macroeconomic forecasts \u2014 an outlook that represents a substantial change in the assumptions underlying the current fiscal strategy. With the change in outlook, it can be assumed that Treasury revenues will contract markedly and that the outcome could deteriorate by as much as ISK 35bn per year in 2019 and 2020, excluding all mitigating measures. As a result, the Government will recommend to the Parliamentary Budget Committee that the fiscal strategy plan be revised to include measures guaranteeing a balanced budget.\nEconomy highly resilient\nEconomic reforms put in place by the authorities in recent years have prepared the economy to face temporary headwinds. Among these reforms are the reconstruction of the financial system on a sound footing, the cancellation of customs duties and excise taxes, and the reduction in the payroll tax. In addition to these are extensive Government measures aimed at facilitating successful wage settlements: for example, significant tax cuts \u2014 particularly for those with below-average wages \u2014 strong support for families with children, and multi-faceted measures in response to problems in the housing market.\nThese policy actions bolster economic stability even further. Households\u2019 and businesses\u2019 debt and equity position is much stronger than in the last economic downswing, and the substantial reduction in Treasury debt has enhanced the resilience of the economy. The public sector is therefore in a good position to support the economy as it gathers momentum for a new growth phase.\nA fiscal surplus is the goal\nThe current fiscal statement assumes an overall fiscal surplus of 1.4% in 2018 and 1% per year, on average, in 2019-2022. The proposed revised strategy takes account of the changed outlook from 2019 onwards, yet it provides for a positive overall balance over the horizon of the strategy. The overall balance will be required to be above -0.4% of GDP in both 2019 and 2020, -0.3% in 2021, and in balance in 2022. For precautionary reasons, the revised policy grants a scope for up to 0.4% of GDP in 2019-2022 vis-\u00e0-vis the targets for the overall balance to be set in annual five-year fiscal strategy plans. In other words, it is the Government\u2019s intention that the targets in the fiscal strategy plans will provide outcomes that will be more favorable by at least this margin.\nIf economic developments and the assumptions underlying the projections turn out worse than is currently assumed, it will be permissible to use that margin to adjust the fiscal outcome to the same degree. Apart from that, it is assumed that the authorities will take appropriate action, if need be, so as to ensure that the outcome in the fiscal strategy plan and the fiscal budget will be over and above the margin for uncertainty provided in the fiscal policy statement. \nIn other words, this means that even though changed economic forecasts inevitably lead to more modest performance targets in coming years, and even though the revised fiscal policy provides some scope, the Government aims to ensure continued deficit-free operations.\nRevision in compliance with fiscal rules\nThe revised fiscal policy statement is consistent with the numerical fiscal rules prescribed in the Act on Public Finances as requirements for both the fiscal policy statement and the fiscal strategy plan. The overall balance should neither become poorer than -2.5% of GDP in a single year, nor be negative over the five-year period. Therefore, the proposed Parliamentary resolution does not recommend a temporary suspension of the fiscal rules in the Act on Public Finances, even though the Act allows for it when the fiscal policy statement needs to be revised due to a major alteration in its premises.", "id": "5ecfa1afd8a9392196c7783e6a865bab"}

The commercial banks\u2019 resilience is good, although it has declined, in part because of dividend payments. Pressures in the housing market have eased, but it is important to keep well abreast of the risk that could stem from commercial real estate prices, which have risen steeply in the recent term. Renewal of trading systems and other bank infrastructure and the renewal of the Central Bank\u2019s real-time gross settlement (RTGS) and netting systems entail temporary operational risk, which monitoring bodies and supervised entities have monitored closely. \n2.\tAuthorisation to set rules on capital buffers\na.\tThe Financial Supervisory Authority considers it desirable to change the wording of the Act on Financial Undertakings, no. 161/2002, pertaining to the imposition of capital buffers. This provision has been interpreted to mean that the Financial Supervisory Authority\u2019s decisions to impose capital buffers have been defined as administrative decisions and have followed the procedures pertaining to such decisions. The Financial Stability Council agrees that it would be better if the Financial Supervisory Authority were granted the authorisation to set rules on capital buffers. If this were done, decisions on capital buffers would be defined as general administrative orders and not administrative decisions. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs will bear this in mind when Act no. 161/2002 is next reviewed, which is scheduled for the autumn 2018 legislative session. \n3.\tImposition of capital buffers\na.\tCapital buffer for systemically important institutions \ni.\tThe proposal to keep the capital buffer unchanged at 2% was approved. \nb.\tCapital buffer due to systemic risk\ni.\tThe proposal to keep the capital buffer unchanged at 3% and lengthen the adaptation period for non-systemically important financial institutions authorised to accept deposits was approved. According to the Financial Supervisory Authority\u2019s decision of 1 March 2016, such companies were required maintain a capital buffer of 3% as of 1 January 2019, but it was agreed to postpone the deadline until 1 January 2020. \nThe meeting was adjourned at 16:20 hrs. on 20 March 2018 and continued at 13:10 hrs. on\nFriday 13 April 2018. \n4.\tImposition of capital buffers, continued\na.\tCountercyclical capital buffer\ni.\tThe proposal to recommend to the Financial Supervisory Authority that the countercyclical capital buffer be increased by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.75%, was approved.

Safety plans for all transport sectors are an element in achieving this. It is also important to carefully maintain and operate transportation infrastructure in the interest of traffic safety.\u00a0\nThe authorities\u2019 targets for traffic safety are as follows:\nFirst, the number of traffic fatalities per 100,000 residents should at least be at par or lower than the numbers in countries with the best record. Second, the number of traffic fatalities and injuries should decline, on average, by at least 5% per year through 2022. During the period 2009-2017, from 14 to 19 people died in traffic accidents each year, apart from 2010, when there were eight fatalities, and 2014, when there were four.\nThe traffic safety plan is a part of Iceland\u2019s transport policy plan. It is reviewed annually where safety measures are revised and new ones added as budgetary allocations permit. The plan is administered by the Ministry of Transport and Local Government and implemented in cooperation with the Iceland Road Administration, the Icelandic Transport Authority and the National Police Commissioner.\nMeasures to address traffic safety fall into four categories:\n\nTravellers\n\nPoliceing, education programs, and information campaigns\n\n\nRoad system\n\nRisk analysis (accident black spot analysis) and road improvements\n\n\nMotor vehicles \u00a0\n\nVehicle registration and vehicle monitoring\n\n\nLegislation and research\n\nStatistical collection and analysis\u00a0\nLegislative impoprovements\n\n\n\nThe authorities allocate approximately ISK 400 million annually to projects and tasks in these areas, including policeing, advertising and education, safety measures at accident scenes and road environment, research, and regular surveys of driving behaviour.\nMonitoring of driving speeds is the most extensive task involving travellers. It consists primarily of speed monitoring cameras that have been installed in numerous locations along the nationwide highway network, including tunnels. Education, presentations, and advertisements for travellers are an important means of enhancing traffic safety. Particular emphasis is placed on traffic safety education in primary schools and on teaching foreign drivers about road conditions in Iceland.\nAmong provisions relating to the road system is the elimination of so-called accident black spots through measures taken to increase safety in areas where traffic accidents occur frequently. Such measures include lengthening and improving guardrails, improving hazardous road environment areas, marking one-lane bridges, and building rest areas along the national highway network.", "id": "61ae1b2b096e38ebbd5c003c8f9669ed"}

The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Commerce from Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and the United Kingdom met today in a teleconference to formally confirm the successful conclusion of the free trade agreement.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u201cA free trade agreement with the United Kingdom has been a priority during my term in office and it will be crucial for both businesses and consumers. I have stressed the importance of ensuring a strong future relationship with the United Kingdom following its departure from the European Union. I am convinced that this agreement will strengthen the economic relations and the bonds of friendship between Iceland and the United Kingdom for years to come,\u201d said Gudlaugur Th\u00f3r Th\u00f3rdarson, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development Cooperation of Iceland.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe new free trade agreement is progressive and comprehensive covering most areas of trade between the states and related rules. In light of the fact that the United Kingdom remains one of Iceland\u2019s most important export markets and the close ties between the countries, the conclusion of an agreement with the United Kingdom was vital.\u00a0\nThe agreement provides mutual access to markets with specific conditions in relation to trade in goods, in services and public procurement. Iceland\u2019s core interests, with respect to trade in goods, are guaranteed, including trade in fish and agricultural products. The Agreement also facilitates trade in services between the states in addition to providing access for Icelandic businesses to public procurement in the United Kingdom.\nThe agreement contains ambitious commitments in the area of environmental protection and the battle against global warming as well as commitments in the field of labour law. It also contains a special chapter on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in trade. This is the first time that a trade agreement concluded by Iceland contains such provisions.\u00a0\n\u201cAmong Iceland\u2019s main focal points during the negotiations was the importance of gender equality, in accordance with the main policies of the government. It is therefore of great satisfaction that the agreement contains provisions about the economic empowerment of women where the importance of gender equality and gender perspectives are reaffirmed,\u201d said Gudlaugur Th\u00f3r Th\u00f3rdarson.\nThe Agreement is very comprehensive in comparison with other free trade agreements concluded by Iceland. In addition to the provisions discussed above, it contains provisions in the field of intellectual property rights, sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, technical regulations, state aid, competition, chapter on small and medium-sized enterprises, good regulatory practices among many other subjects.\nThe negotiations with the United Kingdom on a free trade agreement were initiated as a result of the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union and began formally in September last year. The UK\u2019s departure from the EU had a significant effect on relations between Iceland and the United Kingdom which in turn made it necessary to renegotiate a number of agreements, including in the field of foreign trade.

At that time the government agreed to the Decision and since then negotiations have been underway.\nAccording to the agreement, Landsvirkjun pays annual remuneration to the Icelandic State for the duration of 65 years (backdated to January 1, 2017). Furthermore, it is anticipated that the remuneration amount will be reviewed at the end of that period. Landsvirkjun will also pay for the utilisation rights from the date when the Act of Public Lands came into force, to year end 2016. Later this year Landsvirkjun will pay ISK 1.5 billion in charges now due, but future annual payments will amount to ISK 90 billion, plus indexation.\nThe remuneration is not expected to affect Landsvirkjun\u2019s future dividend payments. Over the last four years, Landsvirkjun\u2019s dividend payments to the Icelandic State have amounted to ISK 22 billion.\nThe decision for renumeration for water rights is based on the value of similar rights and the antecedent of the power plants in question. The Supreme Court ruling no. 233/2011, where the value of rights in connection to the Flj\u00f3tsdalur Power Station was in question, weighed heavily in the decision making. Consideration is given to the efficiency of power plants, resulting in increased charge when the initial capital expenditure/power-generating capacity is lower. Remuneration for usage of land resources is based on rulings of the Assessment Committee, regarding eminent domain compensation and equivalent agreements.\nIt is anticipated that other energy producers in a similar position as Landsvirkjun, i.e., where agreements for existing power plants have not been reached with the Icelandic State, will be offered comparable agreements.\nKatr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, Prime Minister of Iceland:\n\u201cI am pleased that an agreement has finally been reached. Landsvirkjun is an important publicly owned company, and this agreement reinforces its position, as well as concluding this matter. Furthermore, the principle of reasonable remuneration for the utilisation of the country\u00b4s natural resources is emphasised.\u201d\n\u00a0\nH\u00f6r\u00f0ur Arnarson, CEO Landsvirkjun:\n\u201cWe welcome this agreement. Even though Landsvirkjun has, in accordance with sectoral law, a protected right for the utilisation of resources in this area, an agreement for remuneration for the utilisation had not been in place before. This agreement validates the right of utilisation for the national power company, providing an important predictability. Landsvirkjun\u2019s energy production from Iceland\u2019s renewable natural resources, is paramount for our contribution to climate issues, in addition to being economically profitable. Landsvirkjun\u2019s dividend payments to the Treasury will continue to increase and are anticipated between ISK 10 to 20 billion annually, in the coming years.\u201d", "id": "63628118771032f08de4d7b8a0083ea8"}

This procedure will remain in place until 1 May, when cautious steps will be taken to ease restrictions, based on the epidemiological situation at passenger's point of departure. This was decided at today's cabinet meeting.\nThe decision by the Government is a continuation of the procedure that has been in place since 19 August when the system of double screening was established. The option to choose a 14-day quarantine instead of screening will however be removed. Less than one percent of arriving passengers have opted for that option in recent weeks.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are fortunate to have been able to get the most recent wave under control, which is why we want to take these precautionary steps now. The remarkable patience, understanding and adherence to domestic restrictions, that our people have shown has been key to the progress made so far, as well as success in limiting the inflow of new sources of infection at the border. While we are all looking forward to life returning to normal, and welcoming visitors from around the world, it remains vital for us to safeguard our position while we gradually increase protection of the population with our vaccination efforts,\" says Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, Prime Minister of Iceland.\n\nThese changes are in line with recommendations by the ECDC and the Chief Epidemiologist of Iceland, whose assessment indicates that there is considerable risk of new infections \"leaking\" through the border, especially from individuals who choose not to be tested at the border. It is especially important to minimize the risk of new variants of the virus spreading in Iceland, but these have repeatedly been detected and stopped at the border. Therefore, the Minister of Health has issued a regulation that mandates screening and removes the option to quarantine for 14 days. Only in rare circumstances, such as in the case of valid medical reasons, will exemptions be made.\n\nOn 1 May cautious steps will be taken to ease restrictions if the epidemiological situation internationally allows. With the ongoing vaccination programs throughout the world, a gradual improvement in the situation is expected, which will open possibilities to make travelling easier from areas where the pandemic is under control, while maintaining restrictions on travel from areas where the situation warrants such precautions.\nArriving passengers who are in possession of valid documentation\u00a0that proves prior infection or vaccination against covid-19 are exempt from all exempt from screening and quarantine measures. Currently, only positive PCR-tests and certificates of presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 from a laboratory within the EEA/EFTA-area or a confirmation from the Chief Epidemiologist in Iceland are accepted. All those who present a valid international vaccination certificate for full vaccination with an approved vaccine against COVID-19 are exempt. \n\u00a0\nHowever,\u00a0certificate of vaccination against COVID-19 or confirmation of previous COVID-19 infection can not exempt individuals from the current travel restrictions. These certificates can only exempt individuals who are already authorised to travel to Iceland from quarantine and testing requirements. Third country citizens who have had full vaccination against COVID-19 or have a confirmed previous COVID-19 infection can therefore still not travel to Iceland unless they can present documents upon arrival to prove to be exempt from the current travel restrictions.\n\nThe Government of Iceland anticipates that vaccination will gradually reduce the risk that stems from the pandemic, while efforts to contain the spread of the virus remain of paramount importance. In light of this, the border measures will be reviewed monthly, primarily with the aim to implement easing of restrictions if the situation allows.\nColour coding at the border this summer\nAfter 1 May the border measures will be based on the regularly updated data published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Countries will be risk-assessed into green, orange, and red zones according to the epidemiological situation. Considering Iceland's unique geographical position, the measures at the border will most likely be stricter than those prescribed by the EU, at least initially. Passengers from low-risk countries will be exempt from quarantine and a second screening if they can provide proof of a negative PCR test prior to departure.\n\nThe classification into risk-categories will be based on EU recommendations:\n\u00a0\n\n14-day incidence rate\nPositivity rate\nTesting rate\n\nThe risk assessment will be based on the following criteria:\n\nGreen means that the 14-day incidence rate is below 25 per 100 thousand inhabitants, and less than 4% of tests are positive.\nOrange means that the 14-day incidence rate is below 50 per 100 thousand inhabitants, but the positivity rate exceeds 4%; or the 14-day incidence rate is between 25 and 150 but the positivity rate is below 4%.\nRed applies if the situation is more severe.\nGrey applies to countries where information is insufficient or fewer than 300 tests are performed per 100 thousand each week.\n\nThe rules that will apply to each risk category after 1 May are:\n\nThe aim of today's decision is to convey as much predictability as possible.

Developing such indicators is a step towards ensuring common understanding of what factors make our lives better.\nAccording to a survey commissioned by the committee, the general public in Iceland views health (i.e. good health and access to healthcare) to be the most significant factor in quality of life. This was followed by relationships (i.e. with friends, family, neighbours and colleagues), housing (secure housing, cost of housing, supply of housing) and making a living (income and assets). \nKart\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, Prime Minister, introduced the proposed indicators in the Inclusive Growth and Well-being Symposium in Reykjav\u00edk on 16 September.

These precautions are meant to minimize the likelihood of false negative results from border screening leading to cluster infections in Iceland. \nDuring the first five days after arrival in Iceland, Icelanders and residents in Iceland should: \n\nnot attend gatherings of more than ten people, \navoid close contact with individuals that are at risk of severe illness or otherwise vulnerable to the disease, \nmaintain a distance of two meters when interacting with others, \navoid handshakes and hugs, \npractice good personal hygiene such as thorough handwashing. \n\nHowever, during this period, Icelanders and residents in Iceland\u00a0can: \n\nuse public transport to reach their destination, \ngo for a drive, \ngo grocery shopping, \nmeet friends and family with the above-mentioned limitations \n\nIcelandic citizens and residents in Iceland, who choose to be tested upon arrival in Iceland must undergo a second PCR-test, free of charge, four to five days after arrival.

The outlook is stable.\nResilient domestic demand helped limit Iceland's economic contraction in 2020, which amounted to almost 7% in real terms; the recovery will largely depend on how well tourism rebounds, in S&P\u2019s view. The authorities offered significant fiscal and monetary policy support; S&P expects most measures to be rolled back toward year-end 2021. Contrary to previous crises, external pressures have been manageable; the current account remained in a narrow surplus, external leverage is comparatively low, and central bank reserves ample. \nThe stable outlook indicates that Iceland's economy is likely to continue recovering in the second half of 2021. This should allow the authorities to gradually roll back much of the fiscal and monetary policy support that limited the economic contraction and exchange rate volatility during the pandemic. This will limit the increase in public debt over the next few years.\nAccording to S&P, the agency could raise the ratings if the economic recovery from the pandemic exceeds its expectations and the Icelandic economy and export categories become more diverse, reducing the volatility in Iceland's terms of trade. This scenario could enable quicker fiscal consolidation, lowering the government's debt burden to close to pre-pandemic levels.\nS&P could lower the ratings on Iceland if the economic recovery proved more shallow or took longer than currently expected and the tourism sector remained depressed. This could occur if the pandemic sees a resurgence or there is a prolonged shift in travel patterns. In such a scenario, S&P considers that monetary and fiscal support could become a more permanent feature of Iceland's policy mix and could erode policy space and net general government debt levels would rise materially beyond current expectations.\n\nS&P press release", "id": "67dc8db180013ba0a023afb154cfc287"}

The rule does not apply to minors (born 2005 and later) who are exempt from both quarantine and testing requirements.\nDue to the nature of SARS-COV-2 virus, there is a possible risk of an infection escaping detection if the test is performed in the first few days after infection. Two such cases is now thought to have led to what currently appears to be a minor cluster of infections in the Reykjav\u00edk region. Five individuals have tested positive after an Icelandic national returning from the United States tested positive, a few days after initially testing negative at the border. All five individuals are in good health, and no one is hospitalized with COVID-19.\n\"We are following the same strategy of extensive testing, preventative quarantining and contact tracing for any new infections in Iceland which allowed us to respond so effectively at the beginning of the epidemic. By testing at the border and continuing an extensive programme of testing at healthcare clinics, we aim for very early detection of any potential new outbreaks,\" says Chief Epidemiologist Thorolfur Gudnason. \"In a case, such as we have now, where an infection is discovered immediately activate our contact tracing capabilities to direct anyone susceptible to an infection into quarantine. While new cases are of course not what we had hoped for, it was anticipated and we are prepared.\"\nFollowing diligent contact-tracing efforts, a total of 434 people have been ordered into quarantine, as a preventative measure due to the new infection. 1 300 individuals have been tested in relation to these infections and positive cases of the virus have been sequenced to determine the origin of the infection, to confirm that this is indeed a small cluster of related infections.\nAll passengers arriving in Iceland are encouraged to download the country\u2019s contact tracing app regardless of their test results or quarantine period to facilitate contact-tracing in case of infection. The app, which has been developed in line with the strictest privacy standards, stores the user\u2019s location locally on the phone and is only shared with the authorities with the consent of the user in case of infection. The app also provides important information and updates for travellers and allows them to contact health authorities through an online chat, if needed.\n\"Our expectation is that new instances of the virus will appear in Iceland despite the very low levels of active infections we have now reached.

{"date": "March 29, 2022", "title": "Government unveils first fiscal plan: Progress and strong value creation in a progressive society", "content": "Icelandic households and businesses are in a strong position, and the public debt outlook has improved substantially. With moderate spending growth and continued advances in growing export sectors, there are opportunities to solidify economic foundations once again and foster an even stronger society. This is stated in the Government\u2019s fiscal plan for 2023-2027, introduced today.\nThe position is favourable\nThe most extensive pandemic-related economic measures were taken on the basis of the Treasury\u2019s strong position and have delivered undeniable results. Purchasing power has never been higher and continues to grow. Households\u2019 financial position has never been as favourable, as is stated in the fiscal plan introduced today.\nThis can be seen clearly in the strength of Icelandic households and businesses. Unemployment peaked at 11.6% in January 2021 but subsided quickly as the year progressed. It now measures 5.2%, which is close to the pre-pandemic level. Unemployment is now expected to fall even faster than previously estimated, reaching about 4% during the term of horizon of the fiscal plan.\nInflation has risen recently but it is still far lower than in many comparison countries. In Iceland, it now measures 4.4%, according to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), well below the EU average of 6.2%. Inflation is expected to subside with responsible fiscal and monetary policies and labour market developments. The strategy laid down in the Government\u2019s fiscal plan contributes to this.\nIn 2021, an all-time record 7,000 people bought their first home. Even though interest rates have risen, they have increased from a historically low level. Households asset position is generally strong, with a large amount of accumulated savings. The share of households in arrears has never been lower than in 2021, when it measured 0.9% at the year-end. \n\nIn recent years, the Treasury has supported the construction of social housing for the rental market through the public housing system. Stabilising the housing market with the involvement of municipalities, the social partners, and the Treasury is a task of vital importance during the horizon of the fiscal plan, and the authorities will do their part to bring this about.\nFiscal sustainability reclaimed\nAn ongoing project over the next few years will be to safeguard Treasury performance and re-establish fiscal sustainability in the wake of the pandemic. The post-pandemic fiscal deficit has proven to be much smaller than previously anticipated, however.\nNow that the pandemic is on the wane in Iceland, public discourse is centred on the economic impact of the war in Ukraine. Thus far, this impact has been seen not least in soaring commodity prices, compounding the effects of supply-demand mismatches following the pandemic. A surge in refugees and even greater global uncertainty could create other challenges further ahead.\nPublic sector debt did not hinder Iceland\u2019s response to the economic repercussions of the pandemic, as there was sufficient scope to take on debt. Icelandic society stood on solid ground because of responsible economic policy during the years beforehand. Now it is of paramount importance to re-establish that solidity. The Government\u2019s objectives centre on steadily narrowing the deficit and halting the rise in the public debt-to-GDP ratio no later than 2026. This will strengthen the country\u2019s foundations and better prepare Icelandic society to respond to unexpected shocks in the future.\nFocus on tech solutions and increased synergy in purchasing\nImproved public service is not solely a question of increased spending. There are enormous opportunities in utilisation of tech solutions, remote services and digitisation, institutional mergers, and greater synergy in the purchase and operation of systems.\nOn the website Island.is, it is already possible to access over 900 State service procedures, digital mailboxes, and a number of self-service applications, including for childbirth leave, police clearance certificates, health insurance, and various Commissioners\u2019 services. Over the horizon of the fiscal plan, digitisation efforts will continue, with the objective of making public services simpler and more efficient.\nThe benefits of digitisation in the form of streamlining and greater operational efficiency have been estimated at ISK 9.6bn per year at the end of the five-year investment initiative currently underway. In addition to this is the indirect benefit to the whole of society, in the form of shorter processing times at public institutions and time saved by individuals and companies, which could total as much as ISK 20bn.\nWelfare safeguarded\nOver horizon of the fiscal plan, spending on healthcare weighs heaviest, at 31%, followed by spending on social, housing, and insurance affairs, at 27%. In all, nearly 60% of total expenditures fall into these two categories. The third-highest expenditure category is education and culture, at 12% of the total. The cumulative increase in framework expenditures is estimated at ISK 69bn from the 2022 National Budget until 2027. This is equivalent to a 7% increase at constant 2022 prices.\nStrengthening mental health service is a priority issue for the Government, and the fiscal plan provides for an even further increase in allocations to mental health over the horizon. This will make it possible to establish mental health teams at community health centres nationwide, strengthen preventative measures, and provide wide-ranging, multidisciplinary mental health service tailored to users\u2019 diverse needs. A permanent increase in mental health allocations in the amount of ISK 500m is planned for the first year of the fiscal plan, with an increase of ISK 100m per year in the two years to follow.\nIt is also worth noting that during the term of the fiscal plan, there are plans for increased allocations for a review of the disability portion of the social insurance scheme, with emphasis placed on vocational rehabilitation and various labour market initiatives. Next year, the first step will be taken towards a new, fairer system with an allocation of ISK 430m, which will be used for various projects designed to foster a wider range of employment opportunities for people with reduced ability to work.\nStrong economic pillars increase in number\nOver the horizon of the fiscal plan, investment in a strong society and support for the ongoing advancement of growing export sectors will continue. Public sector investment will average 3.6% of GDP over the period, including with support for green investment through the tax system and sustained and increased support for research and development. An investment of ISK 90bn in the ongoing construction of the new Landsp\u00edtali hospital on Hringbraut is planned, in addition to the ISK 24.4bn allocated to the project during the last electoral term.\nExport revenues from intellectual property are now estimated at 10% of Iceland\u2019s exports, after doubling since 2014 and increasing by 50% since 2018. Employers in technology, intellectual property, high-tech services, information technology, and telecommunications have increased in number by over 300 in three years\u2019 time and now account for over 18% of all employers in the exchange economy. For comparison, employers in the tourism industry account for 12%.\nIceland now ranks 17th out of 132 countries on the WIPO Global Innovation Index, having risen from 23rd place in four years. This growth in the intellectual property industry comes in addition to improved returns in the fishing and energy-intensive sectors. Furthermore, aquaculture has grown faster than other sectors, with export revenues trebling since 2018.\nBjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs:\nThrough moderate spending growth coupled with a public investment initiative, strong support for innovation and R&D, and a favourable environment for the germination of new ideas in our society, we lay the foundation for a new GDP growth phase. On the basis of this fiscal plan, we will move in steadfast steps towards renewed fiscal equilibrium and a low debt-to-GDP ratio. \n\nPriority will be given to controlling inflation and ensuring economic stability, thereby contributing to moderate interest rates for households and businesses. A successful fiscal-monetary-labour market policy mix plays a key role in this endeavour.\u201d", "id": "68ed961da4f33d65a15d32c55c27957f"}

We have also advocated for much-needed reforms in the work and composition of the Council where we continue to see certain member states elected as full members, passing judgements and casting votes abroad while their human rights record at home should be on trial.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of climate change, Foreign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson was unambiguous. \u201cThis is not a distant abstraction, but a stark reality. In the Arctic, including in my country, we are witnessing glaciers melting and vanishing, and our seas and marine life are rapidly changing,\u201d said Th\u00f3rdarson before adding that the effect of climate change on the oceans should not be underestimated. \u201cThe fight against climate change needs to begin at home, but the high-income countries also need to support lower-income countries in addressing the causes and consequences of climate change. This is a focus area in Iceland\u00b4s new development cooperation policy and, earlier this week, my Government announced that we would double our contributions to the Green Climate Fund.\u201d\n\nIn his address Minister Th\u00f3rdarson expressed his belief that open, fair, and free trade was single most important driver for economic growth and stability. He also urged further research to address non-communicable diseases and neurological disorders, including spinal cord injuries, that affect up to a billion people worldwide. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson discussed various conflicts and crises in the world, e.g. in Syria and Yemen. \u201cRegional powerbrokers, which fuel tensions and fund the warring parties, need to step back in support of a peaceful political process.\u201d\n\nIn his concluding remarks, the Foreign Minister paid tribute to the generation that built the United Nations after the horrors of the Second World War and its legacy. \u201cWe must never forget that our rules-based international system is based upon determination and awareness that derived from one of the greatest tragedies in human history. We must never take it for granted.\u201d\n\nDuring his visit to New York, Foreign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson had several bilateral meetings, e.g. with the foreign ministers of Cabo Verde, North Macedonia, Andorra, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan. He also took part in a meeting of the so-called Green Group, an informal six-state forum on climate-related issues. Furthermore, the Foreign Minister and his Liberian counterpart signed an air services agreement between Iceland and Liberia at their meeting on September 27.\n\nThe entire speech of Foreign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson at the General Assembly has been published on the Government of Iceland website.

This means that Iceland will meet its binding Effort Sharing reduction target of 29% and even more - with a 35% reduction.\nIn addition to this, further 5-11% emission reduction is expected from measures that are presented in the plan but remain yet to be quantified, a total of 40-46% reduction.\n\n\nPrime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir: \u201cDecisions and strategies based on science provide the best foundation for success, as events this spring have so clearly demonstrated. The government\u2019s Climate Action Plan is based on such a foundation, which is very gratifying. It is our duty to safeguard the interests and well-being of future generations, and we do this by taking decisive action on climate issues, that will help prevent the unforeseeable consequences of catastrophic global warming. I am proud to head a government that is presenting this plan, that demonstrates that we can achieve ambitious climate targets.\"\nGu\u00f0mundur Ingi Gu\u00f0brandsson, Minister for the Environment and Natural Resources: \u201cThis new Climate Action Plan marks a turning point in climate issues in Iceland. Immediately in its first months in office, the government undertook climate actions and allocated funding towards these issues. With the measures that we have now taken and intend to implement, we will achieve greater progress than international commitments under the Paris Agreement require of us. Which is definitely to be celebrated. We intend to continue to further our efforts to ensure the necessary transformation.\"\nOver a five-year period, from 2020 to 2024, ISK 46 billion will be allocated to the major climate actions. The Action Plan consists of 48 measures, including 15 new ones, which have been added since the first version of the plan was released in the autumn of 2018. In tandem with the extensive consultation process for the new version of the Action Plan, emphasis has been placed on implementing these measures immediately. As a result, 28 of the 48 measures have already been set in motion.\nBjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs: \u201cWe are meeting our international commitments and doing even better - not by imposing strict obligations on households and the business community but rather with a wide variety of measures, that extend across the entire society, and by encouraging developments that are already taking place towards a more climate-friendly economy. Projections for emissions indicate that, already as a result of government actions and technological developments, greenhouse gas emissions will decrease in the next few decades, but the Climate Action Plan lays the foundation for even greater achievement.\"\nMore weight has now been placed on changing travelling behaviour, like encouraging walking and cycling and waste management. Various types of climate-friendly changes in society are actively encouraged, and emphasis is placed on actions where the state can lead the way in important changes through its own positive action.\nNew measures included in the Plan following consultations are i.e. measures to increase domestic vegetable production, increase the number of green rental cars, promote energy transition in heavy transport, carbon capture of emissions from industrial processes, improved feeding of livestock to reduce enteric fermentation and mitigation of emissions from the building sector.\nSigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson, Minister of Transport and Local Government: \u201cClimate issues are one of the most urgent challenges of our time and it is significant that the nations of the world have joined hands in response. Iceland's plan is ambitious. One important aspect is to ensure that the public can take part in the changes that need to take place and feel that each and every person\u2019s contribution matters. Energy transition in transport plays a major role here. It is also clear that Iceland has economic interests at stake in switching to green energy sources because many billions currently flow out of the country to buy fossil fuels.\"\nUnderpinning this new version of the Action Plan are detailed calculations of the benefits of the measures presented. They were assessed by experts from the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, advisors from the Environment Agency and a team of scientists at the University of Iceland and the University of Reykjavik. It was possible to assess the benefits of 23 actions, through which Iceland will achieve an estimated 35% reduction in emissions by 2030. Due to their nature, it is not possible to assess the impact of nine actions. In addition to this, further 5-11% reduction of emissions, is expected from 16 measures presented in the plan but remain yet to be quantified, which would make the total reduction 40-46%.\nThis second version of the Climate Action Plan presented today will continue to be subject to continuous review, just as the previous version. Measures will be updated, and new ones added as needed to ensure the Plan's continued success.\nThe Climate Action Plan was prepared by a task force comprising representatives of the Prime Minister; Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture; Minister of Tourism, Industry and Innovation; Minister of Education, Science and Culture; Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs; Minister of Transport and Local Government; and Association of Local Authorities in Iceland, under the leadership of the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources.\nThe Climate Action Plan has now been placed in the government\u2019s Consultation Portal for the next three months, offering the general public the opportunity to submit comments and suggestions until 20 September this year.", "id": "6caa1b6249d033468daa75f703fe2840"}

After multiple clusters of infections were detected (largely in two primary schools in Iceland), these new measures will remain in place for three weeks. A total of 89 people in Iceland are currently in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19. This is the highest number in isolation since 20 January.\u00a0\nThe new measures have been rolled out following the identification of cases of a new variant in Iceland, which has increased transmissibility and potentially more serious health consequences for young people.\nThe B.1.1.7. strain has been shown to have more serious implications for older children. This has led to the decision to include all children born in 2014 or earlier in the 10-person limit on gatherings that will now apply in most settings.\nAll schools, except for preschools, will be closed until after the Easter holidays at the earliest with primary school closures to be re-evaluated in time for their scheduled return after the holidays. This marks the first time during the pandemic that children under the age of 16 will have their schooling impacted. This is in part due to emerging information about more serious symptoms among older children infected with COVID-19.\n\"Our experts agree, and our experience shows, that early intervention is much preferable to a wait-and-see approach. We are facing the potential of an onset of a new wave of infection at a time when the current level of vaccination does not offer sufficient protection against the virus. Therefore, we will exercise utmost caution in the belief that our test-and-trace system will help us get this wave under control as soon as possible. We are all looking forward to a future, not very far off, when the risks posed by the virus will become much more manageable through increased protection with vaccination. Until that time we will make the necessary sacrifices to limit the spread of the virus, and the Icelandic people have shown great resilience and we all have a strong sense of being in this battle together,\" says Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, Prime Minister of Iceland.\nIceland is part of the EUs common procurement programme for vaccine and is entitled to receive vaccines on the same schedule as other countries that form the alliance. This commitment has been reiterated by the EU after yesterday's news that Iceland was no longer exempted from the EUs authorisation mechanism for vaccine exports.\u00a0\n\"While it is extremely important to have received assurances that there will be no implications in terms of deliveries of vaccine to Iceland, we have expressed our disappointment to our EU partners and fully expect that the law and spirit of the EEA agreement will be respected especially during these tense times,\" says Gudlaugur Th\u00f3r Th\u00f3rdarson, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development Cooperation of Iceland.\nIceland\u2019s Minister of Health has announced that the use of AstraZeneca vaccine will be resumed in Iceland after a pause while possible side effects have been examined. The vaccine will be used for people over the age of 70.\nOverall, Iceland has had comparatively low levels of infections, hospitalisations and fatalities throughout the pandemic, all while enjoying long stretches of time with only relatively mild restrictions on social and economic activity. A strategy of early testing, contact tracing, isolation of cases and quarantine for those exposed to infection has been in place since the beginning of the pandemic. These efforts, as well as the co-operation of the public, remain the cornerstones of Iceland's COVID-19 response.\nThe current 14-day incidence rate per 100 thousand is 9.3 and one person is hospitalized due to COVID-19.

The grant will enable the company to provide around 200,000 low-income patients in India access to eye screening next year, as the RetinaRisk calculator, that is a first of its kind internationally, can double eye screening capacity in India with its personalized approach.\nToday, diabetes is one of the leading causes of blindness in people of working age around the world, but visual impairment can be prevented in over 90% of cases with early detection and timely treatment. The International Diabetes Association (IDF) estimates that currently there are around half a billion people with diabetes and that this number will exceed 700 million in 2045. In India alone, there are over 70 million people with diabetes, which is expected to reach 125 million by 2045. As today, only a small portion of the Indian diabetic population has access to regular eye screening, increasing capacity and efficiency is of great importance for patients and healthcare providers.\nRetinaRisk estimates that around two hundred thousand low-income individuals will gain access to eye screening during the grant period due to increased efficiency provided by RetinaRisk to hospitals, many of which offer around a third of their services to this target group for free. The grant enables the company to set up a local integration and distribution team that will work within and in collaboration with the charity hospital Sankara Nethralaya in Chennai, India. The hospital specializes in ophthalmology and provides about 35% of all its services free of charge to low-income populations. Scientifically proven risk assessments such as RetinaRisk, offer healthcare professionals the opportunity to identify high-risk patients in a timely manner and to take necessary steps to prevent vision loss. The risk calculator empowers and motivates patients towards enhanced diabetes control and enables smarter prioritization within the healthcare system.\nThe RetinaRisk project directly supports several of the UN Sustainability Development Goals, including increased access to healthcare (SDG 3), particularly for low-income individuals (SDG 10) and makes diabetic eye screening more efficient and cost-effective, while preventing people being forced out of the workforce due to blindness (SDG 8/9); and at the same time significantly reduce the carbon footprint with fewer unnecessary doctor's visits (SDG13).\nThe Sustainable Development Goals Partnership Fund aims to support Icelandic companies who are interested in advancing the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals through cooperative projects in developing countries.

Events for up to 500 seated people will be allowed if certain requirements are met. Restrictions in schools will mostly remain unchanged. This is the substance of the amendments to the regulation on social gatherings that enters into force on January 29 by decision of the Minister of Health.\nThe Minister of Health presented the intended changes in a government meeting this morning.

Rapid tests will not be required.\nRestrictions in schools will remain unchanged, although they will be adapted to the aforementioned easing measures as applicable.\nThe regulation will apply for just under four weeks or until 24 February.\n\nThe minister deviated slightly from the recommendations of the Chief Epidemiologist, i.e. by having the new rules enter into force earlier, extending the opening times of licenced establishments by two hours instead of one and raising the maximum number of people allowed in stores.\nPlan for the easing of restrictions and its premises\nIn his memorandum, the Chief Epidemiologist presents a plan for the lifting of public measures, which he deems appropriate to implement in steps. The Chief Epidemiologist emphasizes that during the easing of restrictions, it can be expected that the number of infections in the community will increase temporarily, which can both have the effect of increasing the number of people who fall seriously ill and also disrupt the operations of many businesses due to employee illness. This may create an emergency in many workplaces that will require special remedies and businesses will have to be prepared to operate for some time with a reduced number of staff members. It is important to keep in mind that the pandemic will not be over until herd immunity is reached, which might happen in around two months. The Chief Epidemiologist believes that in view of the above it is prudent to assume that all restrictions will be lifted by mid-March 2022 as long as the current presumptions hold, i.e. new variants of the virus will not emerge and there will be no increase in serious illness that will put excessive strain on the health system or too many absences due to illness in various businesses that will lead to emergencies.\nThe Minister of Health and the government will base further easing of restrictions on the plan, and the situation will be evaluated regularly, in particular the pressure on the health system, and appropriate measures will be taken in accordance with the situation. This may mean that restrictions will be lifted earlier than planned or postponed if the circumstances change, such as due to new variants of the virus.\n\nThe Chief Epidemiologist\u2019s memorandum from 26 January 2022 on the lifting of public restrictions due to COVID-19.", "id": "6fdb582f5e8f3cf4bf454b85bef1faf0"}

On that date, some cautious relaxations will be made to the restrictions on the size of gatherings, and the new rules will remain in force until 12 January 2021. The rules applying in schools will continue unchanged, for the most part, until the end of the year; it is planned to announce new rules shortly that will take effect in schools on 1 January 2021.\nDelicate situation\nThese changes are for the most part in accordance with the recommendations from the Chief Epidemiologist. As has been reported, there have been ups and downs in the pattern of COVID-19 infections since the current restrictions were imposed. A noticeable surge in infections took place at the end of November, but the past few days have seen a fall in the infection rate, with most cases diagnosed being in people who are already in quarantine. \u201cIt is therefore clear that we have managed to control the pandemic to a reasonable extent at the moment,\u201d says the Chief Epidemiologist, \u201cbut at the same time the situation can be described as delicate. Things could go either way.\u201d\nPrincipal changes to the restrictions on gatherings\n\nSize restrictions: With certain exceptions, a maximum of 10 persons continues to apply. \nChildren: The provisions on maximum size of gatherings, social distancing and the obligation to use face-masks do not apply to children born in or after 2005.\nShops: All shops may admit 5 customers for every 10 m\u00b2 of their floor area, up to a maximum of 100 persons.\nRestaurants: Up to 15 customers may be admitted to each restricted area. Premises may stay open until 10 p.m. but may not admit new guests after 9 p.m.\nSwimming pools and bathing facilities: These may be opened to up to 50% of the maximum number of guests permitted under their operating licences.\nSports under the auspices of the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland (\u00cdS\u00cd): Sports training sessions for persons born in or before 2004 are permitted, whether or not they involve physical contact, in sports in the senior league of \u00cdS\u00cd.Training sessions for prominent athletes in sports for solo participants are permitted. However, training in combat sports which involve physical contact is not permitted. \nOther sport: All persons are permitted to pursue organised training out of doors which does not involve physical contact.\nStage performances, cinema showings and other cultural events will be permitted with up to 30 persons on stage; this applies to both rehearsals and performances. Up to 50 audience members may be admitted; they shall be seated, and must use face-masks; up to 100 children born in or after 2005 may be admitted. Neither intervals nor the sale of alcoholic beverages during performances are permitted. Seats shall be numbered, and the names of their occupants shall be recorded. \nFunerals: A maximum of 50 guests may attend funerals.\nPeriod of validity: The changes listed above shall be in force from 10 December 2020 until 12 January 2021. \n\nChanges to restrictions in force in schools\n\nThe provisions restricting the mixture of groups and maximum numbers of pre-school (kindergarten) children are set aside. This will make it easier for pre-schools to organise their activities over the Christmas and New Year periods, when groups from different classes or even different pre-schools are often combined.\nUnder the regulations, the 2-m distance rule and the face-mask obligation will no longer apply to pupils in Grades 8-10.\nReading/study areas in the upper secondary schools (pupils aged 16+) and universities may be open for up to 30 persons. \nRules on activities in schools which will take effect on 1 January 2021 will be announced shortly.\nPeriod of validity: The changes listed above will be in force from 10 December until 31 December 2020.\n\nProvisions on review are included in the regulations on measures against the pandemic; these require the authorities to review the need for restrictions in the light of circumstances. The outcome of such reviews may be that they will decide on further relaxation of restrictions, or on tighter restrictions where these are called for.\n\nCOVID-19: Z\u0142agodzenie obostrze\u0144 od 10 grudnia", "id": "71aca6b71c6638b5a1fd0cb68d00feba"}

{"date": "December 10, 2018", "title": "White Paper on a Future Vision for the Financial System", "content": "A good regulatory framework and robust supervision, efficient banking operations and sound ownership of financial undertakings are the three main pillars which need to shape the future vision for the Icelandic financial system. This is the conclusion of the working group appointed in February to prepare a White Paper on the financial system. The group has now completed its work and submitted its report to the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs.\nThe purpose of appointing the working group was to create a solid basis for subsequent discussion, setting a strategy and taking decisions on issues relating to the financial system, its future structure and development. The Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs will request open debate in the Althingi on the contents of the report at the beginning of the spring session, in addition to its discussion by the Economic Affairs and Trade Committee. The White Paper will also be published on the government's consultation portal and readers invited to submit comments on its contents. The government will follow up with proposals for changes to the financial system.\nThe White Paper deals with the transformation which the regulatory framework of the global financial system has undergone since the global banking crisis. This is reflected, among other things, in international rules that have been introduced in a similar form in Iceland as in most developed countries of the world. Risk in the Icelandic banking system has been significantly reduced, banks are more capable of dealing with shocks, supervision is stronger and a contingency plan has been prepared. The working group emphasises that a decision should be taken on drawing a line of defence for investment banking activities by commercial banks and that a centralised debt database be established, which can be utilised by the government and financial undertakings to improve information on household and corporate indebtedness. It is also pointed out that active competitive competition and strong customer discipline are key prerequisites for cost-efficiency benefits to be passed on to consumers and small businesses. These factors are important in order to restore confidence in the Icelandic financial system. \n\n\nFocus on lower interest rates and better terms\nThe White Paper points out that access to financial services on fair and affordable terms is an issue of major concern for households and corporates. In a survey conducted for the working group, lower interest rates and better terms were the factors mentioned most often by respondents as likely to increase confidence in the banking system. In this context the group emphasises the importance of distinguishing between interest rate level and interest margin. High lending rates reflect to some extent the high policy rate which is part of the banks' external environment, while the efficiency of banking operations is reflected in their interest margin and service charges. \nThe report states that the small market size, high taxes and relatively high capital requirements result in what is referred to as the \"Iceland premium\u201d. It is difficult to enlarge this market without increased risk or changing the currency arrangements, and capital requirements are determined by the assessment of various risks. This makes it difficult to reduce these costs in the short term. On the other hand, operating costs could be reduced through increased collaboration in the operation of financial infrastructure and the reduction of specific taxes. Such actions are in the hands of the government and the banks themselves. Active competition and consumer protection, however, increase the likelihood that improved efficiency will benefit consumers.\n\n\nArguments for reducing ownership\nThe White Paper looks at changes to the state\u2019s ownership of financial institutions which will have a significant impact on the future of the financial system. It states that the existing strong regulatory framework and supervision are aimed at ensuring sound ownership by setting requirements for owners of qualifying holdings and limiting the impact of owners. \nIt points out that there are arguments for reducing the state's extensive ownership of financial undertakings in order to reduce the risk, opportunity cost and negative impact on competition. In anticipation of the sale of the banks, priority should be given to reducing specific taxes and setting a statutory line of defence. It is also important that the government consider its overall strategy for long-term ownership, as diversified ownership tends to increase acceptance and reduce risk.\n\nThe Chairman of the working group is L\u00e1rus Bl\u00f6ndal, Supreme Court attorney and Chairman of the Board of Icelandic State Financial Investments. Other members are Gu\u00f0r\u00fan \u00d6gmundsd\u00f3ttir, Head of Liquidity and Financial Undertakings in the Financial Stability Department at the Central Bank of Iceland; Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n R\u00fanarsson, attorney and former managing director of the Icelandic Financial Services Association; and Kristr\u00fan Tinna Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir, economist at Oliver Wyman in Sweden.

The cargo also contains 3500 pairs of wool socks knitted by Icelanders for Ukraine as part of the \u201cSendum hl\u00fdju\u201d project and other wool garments knitted or donated by Icelandic and Ukrainian knitters at knitters\u2019 gatherings. Additionally, the Ministry purchased cold weather clothing and shoes from Fjallakofinn, 66\u00b0N and Dynjandi for close to 50 million ISK, with an actual value of around 150 million.\n\u201cThe cold hand of winter is slowly extending over Ukraine and as we have seen the invading Russian forces are using it as a weapon in the ongoing conflict. As a nation without a military, we cannot supply the Ukrainian armed forces with military equipment, but we can send them warm clothing which is no less important on the bitterly cold battlefield than conventional weapons,\u201d says \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Kolbr\u00fan Reykfj\u00f6r\u00f0 G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir, Minister for Foreign Affairs.\nStaff from the Icelandic Coast Guard packed the goods over the weekend and placed them on pallets that were then loaded aboard the Canadian military transport in the secure area at Keflavik Airport.

The rating is constrained by the small size of the economy and limited export diversification that result in vulnerability to external shocks and capital account risks.\nThe Negative Outlook reflects the uncertainty around the path of the public finances following the Covid-19 shock, which has left the public debt ratio substantially higher than pre-pandemic, and at risk of rising further over the medium-term. Although there is uncertainty around fiscal policy settings post-elections, Fitch thinks that broad political support for rebuilding fiscal buffers and strong record of public debt reduction of 70pp of GDP in 2011-18 supports fiscal-policy credibility over the long-run.\nFuture developments that could result in a positive rating action are greater confidence that the government debt to GDP ratio will decline over time once the Covid-19 crisis has subsided; and sustained economic recovery, for example supported by evidence that the export-oriented sectors, particularly tourism, have been resilient to the pandemic shock.\nFactors that could lead to a negative rating action are evidence that the government\u2019s economic and fiscal strategy will fail to arrest the increase in government debt/GDP ratio over time; and renewed economic weakness or an adverse shock, for example due to a slower-than-expected recovery in tourism, a sustained correction in the real estate market and material negative impact on the banking sector.\nFitch Ratings: Rating Action Commentary", "id": "7900431299d03174979891937d816077"}

The area is in southwest Iceland, about 20km (12.5 miles) from Keflavik International Airport and about 15km (less than 10 miles) from the Reykjav\u00edk metropolitan area. Such a tremor pulse is a strong indicator of intrusive magma movements that could lead to an imminent volcanic eruption. However, no eruption has been confirmed, but the area is being monitored closely.\nA relatively small eruption, of the type classified as a fissure eruption (sometimes referred to as Icelandic-type), is expected. The type of eruption anticipated does not usually involve large explosions or significant production of ash dispersed into the stratosphere. Instead, a relatively slow flow of lava is likely to emerge from a fissure or fissures in the ground.\nScientists anticipate that an eruption could last for a few days up to a few weeks.\nDue to the likely location of the emergence of lava, populated places and critical infrastructure, such as roads and electricity grids, are not expected to be in danger.\nFurthermore, unlike the eruption in Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull in 2010, the current volcanic activity will not produce large fumes that have the potential to disrupt international aviation. However, due to the proximity to Keflavik International Airport, a volcanic eruption would cause temporarily disruptions to air traffic in the immediate vicinity. Initially, Keflavik International Airport, would be closed at the onset of an eruption and a danger area with a radius of 220km established around the eruption point. However, after a forecasted area for ash has been published aviation will continue in accordance with procedures.\u00a0\nThe response to any potential volcanic activity is led by the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management of the police in cooperation with the Icelandic Meteorological Office and University of Iceland. \"We are extremely well prepared to deal with any possible scenario.

S&P expects that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will have a limited impact on Iceland's economy given its minimal direct trade links with those countries and overall limited need for energy commodity imports. The agency also expects fiscal consolidation to accelerate this year, with government debt net of liquid assets settling at about 42% of GDP over the medium term.\nThe stable outlook indicates S&P\u2018s expectation that Iceland's economy will continue to recover and remain relatively unaffected by the war in Ukraine. The agency believes fiscal deficits will continue to decrease over the next few years, stabilizing the debt to GDP ratio net of liquid assets. At the same time, ample foreign reserves will enable the CBI to deal with external pressures or exchange-rate volatility, should they occur.\nAccording to S&P, the agency could raise the ratings if economic growth exceeds expectations, which would likely coincide with stronger export growth and export categories becoming more diverse, reducing external debt or the volatility in Iceland's terms of trade. The agency could lower the ratings if the effects of the war in Ukraine became more pronounced, for example through second-round effects due to lower economic activity in Iceland's main trading partners in Europe or a shift in global travel preferences. The latter could also occur if the pandemic re-emerged, particularly in the form of new and more malignant variants.\n\nS&P - Press release", "id": "7b6a182b3c5138989626f63bfa002f10"}

Our decision to allow travellers from these four countries to enter without unduly burdensome precautions is the result of analysing our own data and the data available to us from these countries, all of which have very low instances of community spread,\" says Thorolfur Gudnason, chief epidemiologist.\nCurrently, there are 12 known active infections in Iceland, and 93 individuals are under quarantine. No one has been hospitalized with COVID-19 in Iceland since 14 May. A total of 1 882 people have recovered from the infection, but ten have died, which gives a 99,5% recovery rate from closed cases. In the past two weeks nine new active infections have been detected, for a total of 2.5 on a per 100 000 inhabitant basis.\n\"It is logical for us to start by looking at these four countries as they represent almost half of the inbound flights to Iceland. Hopefully, we can soon invite travellers from other countries to enter without border screening,\" says Thordis Kolbrun R Gylfad\u00f3ttir, Minister of Tourism. \"This decision is in line with other measures we have taken, namely targeted, high-impact measures based on the best available science, data, and medical judgement.\"\nIceland has pursued a policy of early detection, high volume testing, exhaustive contact tracing, quarantining of at-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. Additionally, innovative treatment methods, including high-touch remote care, have contributed to a successful effort to reduce mortality, morbidity, and strain on medical resources. Primary schools in Iceland have remained open, and no lockdowns have been imposed. There are still restrictions on mass gatherings (no more than 500 people), and restaurants and nightlife establishments must close earlier than normal. In case new infections are detected, and even small clusters of infection, there is a high level of confidence that it will be possible to deal with such issues in a targeted manner, on the basis of the current strategy, without implementing severe society-wide measures.\nDuring the pandemic, a very high emphasis has been placed on personal hygiene measures, such as handwashing, respiratory hygiene (coughing into the elbow), respecting distance when possible, and that anyone showing symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19 goes into self-isolation until they get tested. These personal practices remain of the utmost importance in the upcoming weeks and months.", "id": "821792d5cb8e38ecb2a001a0f9d3ffbd"}

The 2.5% supplement will be paid in addition to the 3.6% increase provided for in the 2021 fiscal budget proposal. With these increases, which total 6.2%, basic unemployment benefits will equal ISK 307,403 per month.\nIncreased payments for support of job-seekers\u2019 children will be extended through the end of 2021, with a 6% supplement added to basic unemployment benefits for each child instead of the previous 4%. Moreover, a December supplement of just over ISK 86,000 will be paid to confirmed job-seekers. \nResilience subsidies\nResilience subsidies will help society to be better prepared for the time when global economic activity opens up again. The resilience subsidies are a direct continuation of the revenue loss subsidies. They are intended to help companies maintain a minimum level of activity while the impact of the pandemic persists. The measure applies to all taxable entities that suffer at least a 60% loss of revenue, irrespective of their operational form. It applies as well to sole proprietors who conduct business activities under their own national ID number.\n\nFor entities suffering revenue losses between 60% and 80%:\n\nThe maximum subsidy ranges up to ISK 400,000 per monthly full-time position equivalent\nCapped at ISK 2 million\n\nFor entities suffering revenue losses between 80% and 100%:\n\nThe maximum subsidy ranges up to ISK 500,000 per monthly full-time position equivalent\n\u00a0Capped at ISK 2.5 million \n\nThe subsidy amounts are based on operating expenses but may not exceed the amount of the revenue loss during the period in question. \n\nIn the case of substantial revenue losses suffered by sole proprietors or very small businesses whose operating expenses consist largely of their estimated salary, the entity is authorised to base operating expenses and the number of full-time position equivalents on figures from the same month in 2019.\nSupport for families with children\nThe means testing threshold in the child benefits system will be permanently raised, thereby ensuring that it changes with developments in the lowest wages in the labour market. This change will ensure that single parents with two children and a monthly income of ISK 350,000-580,000 will receive an annual increase of ISK 30,000 in child benefits, and that for a family whose combined monthly income is ISK 700,000-920,000, child benefits will be ISK 60,000 higher than they would be otherwise. \nSupport for disability pensioners and vulnerable groups\nA one-time payment of ISK 50,000 will be made before 18 December to recipients of disability and rehabilitation pensions who are eligible for pensions during the year, in addition to the December supplement that is usually paid during the month. At the beginning of 2021, permanent changes will be made to the disability pension system. Internal reductions will be scaled down, and the lowest-paid disability pensioners will receive a supplement of nearly ISK 8,000 per month in addition to the planned 3.6% increase provided for in the fiscal budget proposal. The total increase in social security benefits for the lowest-paid disability pensioners will therefore be nearly ISK 20,000 at the turn of the year.\n\nIn addition, a range of mitigating measures will be adopted so as to strengthen vulnerable groups during the pandemic, and a response team on households\u2019 financial position will be established.

This three-day event will be the first conference led by international activists and survivors of gender-based violence since the Brighton conference in 1996 which was inspired by the 1976 International Tribunal on Crimes against Women.\nWhile important gains in the fight against gender-based violence have been made over decades of activism, spurred on by powerful movements like #MeToo and #SayHerName, new forms of violence have also emerged. This event \u2013 which will be held both on-line and in person \u2013 will allow sharing, learning and produce a \u2018Reykjavik Declaration\u2019 on actions aimed to end violence against women and gender-based violence. \nThe outcome of this event will present a collective agenda for activism.

The sale is to take place on the basis of purchase rights to the holding, according to a shareholder agreement from 2009 and the Act on the Sale of State Holdings in Financial Undertakings, no. 155/2012. Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Act explicitly discusses sales relating to the purchase option provision concerning Arion Bank; furthermore, authorisation has been included in the fiscal budgets approved by Parliament since 2014.\nBy law, ISFI administers the State\u2019s holding and protects the State\u2019s interests in connection with the shareholder agreement. According to ISFI\u2019s proposal, the shareholder agreement gives Kaupskil a unilateral, undeniable, and unequivocal contractual right to purchase the State\u2019s holding. \nThe shareholder agreement stipulates how the purchase option price shall be calculated. The price assumes that the State\u2019s capital contribution to the bank earns returns equivalent to the Treasury\u2019s cost of capital on a contribution of ISK 9.9 bn, plus a 5% premium for the period during which the State was the owner of shares in the bank. Dividends received by the Treasury as the owner of the bank during the period \u2013 a total of ISK 2.7 bn \u2013 shall be deducted from the price. In addition to these dividends, the Treasury now receives ISK 23.4 bn for the purchase option, for a total of ISK 26.1 bn. \nISFI engaged auditing firm Grant Thornton to provide confirmation of the purchase price calculation according to the purchase option provisions. In the opinion of ISFI, the Treasury\u2019s returns, which are used as a basis for the calculation of the purchase option price, are good in terms of both interest and risk premium. Calculations show that the State\u2019s average annual nominal return on the capital contribution to Arion Bank since 2008 is about 10.8%. \nWith this transaction, the Treasury is no longer a shareholder in Arion Bank. The authorities will continue to protect the Treasury\u2019s interests vis-\u00e0-vis the bank and the sale of holdings in it on the basis of stability agreements. In this context, it should be noted that the State has considerable interests in the successful sale of Arion Bank, as a well designed and executed transaction maximises the value of the profit-sharing agreement that is a part of stability agreements. The authorities are of the opinion that the outcome is favourable to the Treasury and that it is consistent with the Government\u2019s plans to scale down the State\u2019s holdings in financial institutions. \nThe State\u2019s estimated total profit on the transaction is just over ISK 150 bn. \nEven though the sale is taking place on the basis of a contractual purchase option, it should be noted that the price received for the holding is quite acceptable. The benefit derived from the State\u2019s capital contribution to Arion Bank in the wake of the financial crisis in autumn 2008 lies in return on equity and net interest income on subordinated loans from the Government to the bank. The bank has already repaid the loans. In addition, the Treasury has received substantial income from the stability contribution paid by Kaup\u00feing - i.e., due to the Kaup\u00feing bond, other assets, and estimated income from the profit-sharing agreement. The State\u2019s estimated total gain on financial interests in Arion and transactions with Kaup\u00feing is just over ISK 150 bn. \nThe authorities are strongly committed to ensuring a healthy environment for financial activities and to strengthening the financial framework. The Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs has appointed a task force for a white paper on the vision for Iceland\u2019s financial system. The objective of the work is to create a reliable foundation for discussion, policy formation, and decision-making on issues pertaining to the financial system and its future structure and development.

The outlook on the ratings is stable. \nThe key drivers for the upgrade in the ratings are mainly twofold, firstly Iceland\u2019s sizeable debt reduction gains will be sustained, positioning the country favourably relative to A2-rated peers; and secondly improvements in economic resilience which reduces the country\u2019s inherent vulnerability to shocks. \nThe rating agency points out that Iceland\u2018s government debt has fallen substantially since 2011, more so than in any other rated sovereign in the post-crisis era. Refinements to the fiscal framework, including the Organic Budget Law, will further help to preserve these fiscal improvements. Proceeds from privatisation of SOEs could help to further strengthen the government\u2018s balance sheet according to Moody\u2018s.\nMoody\u2019s has today also raised Iceland\u2019s local currency bond and deposit ceilings to Aa3 from A1, long-term foreign currency bond ceiling to A1 from A3 and long-term foreign currency deposit ceiling to A2 from A3. Moody\u2019s has also raised the short-term foreign currency bond and deposit ceilings to P-1 from P-2.\nIceland\u00b4s rating could be upgraded with marked improvement in its external position and build-up of financial buffers that further reduce its vulnerability to shocks, for instance through large primary surpluses, one-off income flows including from privatisations and further material reduction in government\u00b4s contingent liabilities. \nSharp increase in government debt, disruptive slowdown or other economic shock would have negative effect on the ratings.\nIceland\u00b4s rating outlook has been positive since July 2018.

The strategy is based on the fiscal plan and sets forth targets and criteria for Treasury debt management over the specified period. The key objective of the strategy is to ensure that the Government's financing needs, and payment obligations are met at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long term, assuming a prudent degree of risk.\n\u00a0The 2021-2025 fiscal plan assumes that the Treasury\u2019s borrowing need for the period will be approximately ISK 1.000bn. The Treasury has a variety of options for meeting that need, both domestically and abroad. As before, the main emphasis will be on meeting the financing need by issuing Treasury bonds in the domestic market. Increased emphasis will be placed on foreign borrowing. Liquidity management for the Treasury and HF-Fund will be unchanged in the first half of the period, and the planned sale of the State\u2019s holding in \u00cdslandsbanki will reduce the borrowing need in the coming term. The Treasury\u2019s cash position is strong at present, with ISK-denominated deposits in the Central Bank totalling about ISK 145bn. In addition, the Treasury owns about ISK 220bn in foreign deposits, following the issuance of foreign-denominated bonds. \nThe MTDS lays down the Government\u2019s plans for financing its activities during this period. The strategy describes debt management objectives and guidelines, the structure of the debt portfolio, inherent risk factors, and contingent liabilities. It also describes the institutional structure of debt management and explains how information disclosure to market agents and investors is carried out. \nThe new MTDS is based in large part on its predecessor but reflects changes in emphasis in accordance with the fiscal plan. The main changes are as follows: \n\nIn view of the deterioration of the Treasury outcome, the borrowing need will increase significantly in the next few years. Price formation for two-, five-, and ten-year benchmark Treasury bonds will be ensured, as before, but the maximum size target for outstanding series will be abolished. \nUntil now, foreign loans have been taken primarily to finance the international reserves. Because the financial need over the term of the fiscal plan is significant, it will be met in part with foreign borrowing or by tapping the Treasury\u2019s foreign-denominated deposits with the Central Bank.\nThe overall loan portfolio structure will change as follows: the share of foreign loans will increase to 15-25% of the portfolio, non-indexed loans will account for 50-70%, and indexed loans will account for 20-30%. \nLiquidity management for the Treasury and the HF-Fund will continue to be handled jointly, with the aim of maximising the benefit to the Treasury as a whole. \nClearly defined green and sustainable projects in Iceland could be financed through issuance of so-called green (sustainable) Treasury bonds. A task force representing the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs is currently analysing the feasibility of such an issue. \n\nThe principal objective of the fiscal plan is to halt the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the period. Even though debt is rising steeply, the Treasury\u2019s debt position will be modest in international context, and a favorable interest rate environment means that the Treasury\u2019s interest expense will not rise in line with its debt. The challenges in financing Treasury activities over the period are quite manageable. The Treasury has at its disposal a variety of options for meeting its financial need, its debt level is moderate and its credit ratings sound, the domestic economy has strong growth potential, and confidence in domestic economic policy has increased in recent years. All of these factors strengthen the Treasury\u2019s financing capacity.\n\nMedium-term-debt-management strategy 2021-2025 (PDF)", "id": "8bf27479ede837cab43648bb49537bdc"}

{"date": "September 12, 2022", "title": "2023 fiscal budget proposal: protecting purchasing power and combating inflation", "content": "Safeguarding a strong position and taking targeted but sensible steps forwards \u2013 these are the main tasks for the coming term. This is the main theme of the fiscal budget proposal for 2023, presented today by the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs and set for submission to before Parliament on 13 September.\nThe proposal places emphasis on further strengthening infrastructure and basic services, protecting real wages, and preserving the real value of social security benefits. In other areas, expenditures are reduced after increasing steeply in recent years, so as to combat inflation and strengthen the economic and social pillars for the future.\u00a0According to the budget bill, the central government deficit will amount to ISK 89 bn.\nA new reality\nThe situation in Icelandic society has changed radically in the past two years. Two years ago, aggressive support measures were needed to protect households and businesses and help them to rebound strongly after the pandemic. \nThis has now materialised. Private consumption has never been stronger, tourist numbers are far higher than previously hoped, about half of Icelandic firms are short-staffed, and the outlook is for net migration to be positive by nearly 10,000 persons in 2022. The economy has grown steadily stronger, and unemployment has shrunk in recent months.\nHouseholds\u2019 position has strengthened markedly\nReal wages are at an all-time high, and monthly income per capita has risen by ISK 60,000 in excess of inflation since 2016. Purchasing power has therefore grown by 22% in the interim, and this improvement in living standards has been protected in spite of the rise in inflation. Real wages among low-paid workers who are fully employed have risen more than real wages among high-income workers during the period.\nAn analysis of Icelandic income tax returns, carried out in June, shows that total income has risen for all income groups in recent years, real wages have risen, and the tax burden has been eased for all groups except the highest-paid. Furthermore, 82% of net public revenues from income tax and local tax come from taxpayers in the upper half of the income distribution. Few countries can boast greater equality than Iceland, which also has the lowest proportional poverty rate measured by the OECD.\nStrong income growth, interest rate cuts during the pandemic, households\u2019 strong position, and population growth have led to steep rises in house prices. This has significantly strengthened homeowning households\u2019 asset position, but it also means that it takes longer for prospective buyers to save up for their first home.\nEven so, the share of first-time purchasers among those buying property is not lower now than it has been in previous years. Among other measures, buyers can use private pension savings to save for their first home, and they receive a 50% discount on stamp fees. It is vital to keep working to ensure that entering the housing market does not become even more onerous. One of the Government\u2019s main aims is to increase the supply of reasonably priced homes, and since 2016 the State and local authorities have allocated capital contributions towards 3,100 rental apartments for lower-income groups. There are numerous signs that house price inflation is slowing markedly, that the number of homes for sale has begun to rise, and that the supply of new properties will begin to grow starting in 2023.\nFighting inflation with responsible measures\nThis summer the Government announced changes to the fiscal plan aimed at combating overheating and inflation in the economy, as can be seen, among other things, in the fiscal budget proposal. Measures include permanently reducing the central government\u2019s travel expenses, postponing several expenditures until 2024, and reducing contributions to political parties. Also worth mentioning are a review of planned investment, consolidation of State expenditure following the surge of the past few years, and postponement of part of the new scope for expenditure. No consolidation will be required in connection with social security benefits, unemployment benefits, the judicial system, health insurance, healthcare institutions, or institutions for the elderly.\nIn addition to measures designed to reduce overheating and lower inflation, the Government has placed emphasis on mitigating the effects of inflation on the most vulnerable groups in society through a significant increase in benefits and the introduction of special supplemental child benefits.\nIt is assumed that a large share of increased Treasury revenues from inflation will be used to preserve the real value of social security system benefits and income tax system benchmarks. The budget proposal provides for a 6% increase in social security system benefits, which is 1.1% over and above Statistics Iceland\u2019s inflation forecast.\nRevenue growth through a stronger position\nTreasury revenues are set to increase markedly between years, not least because of favourable economic developments, lower unemployment, and planned measures to reduce overheating and inflation. The increase can be seen in value-added tax, investment tax, personal income tax, and payroll tax, among other things.\nIn coming years, the biggest project for the Treasury on the revenues side will be a comprehensive review of public levies on motor vehicles and fuel. The State\u2019s revenues from motor vehicles and fuel have contracted sharply as progress has been made in transitioning to more fuel-efficient and environment-friendly motor vehicles. New solutions must therefore be found so that the country\u2019s transportation system can be developed and maintained effectively.\nA continually growing group of motor vehicle owners pay very little for their use of the road system, as Treasury revenues from eco-friendly cars are very limited. The aim is to develop a fee system that is more usage-based, and changes to be made in 2023 in motor vehicle taxes, excise taxes, and emissions limits will be designed as the first steps towards such a system. This will bring revenues back towards the previous equilibrium and foster participation by more car owners in the unavoidable cost of maintaining the road system.\nStrengthening basic services and working against overheating\nExpenditure growth is assumed to be modest in 2023, with GDP growth used to strengthen the fiscal position and work against overheating and inflation. Total Treasury expenditure is estimated at ISK 1,296.5bn in 2023, an increase of ISK 78.5bn relative to the 2022 National Budget.\nSpending on social, housing, and insurance affairs will increase the most, but healthcare remains the largest expenditure item by far, at nearly ISK 320bn. Allocations to environmental affairs also increase markedly relative to the prior year, including measures for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions reduction and measures to improve the condition of tourist destinations located within nature conservation areas.\nAllocations to healthcare have increased by ISK 40bn relative to 2020. In addition, emphasis has been placed on:\n\nIncreased allocations for hospital operations.\nConstruction of the new Landsp\u00edtali hospital and development of new nursing home space.\nIncreased allocations for health insurance. \nSteadily improving mental health service. \nReduction of patients\u2019 co-payments. \n\nExpenditures relating to social, housing, and insurance affairs rise the most between years and have increased by ISK 33bn relative to 2020. The expenditures have centred on the following, among other functions: \n\nSteadily improving living standards with stronger basic services and transfer systems such as disability and old-age pension benefits in a changed economic environment.\nCapital contributions for the construction of economical housing; for instance, 3,100 affordable rental apartments have been built with State contributions since 2016. \nIncreased housing benefits to support those most in need.\n\nAbout ISK 26.4bn will be used for various new and expanded projects in 2023. These include: \n\nIncreased allocations for reimbursement of research and development expense. \nIncreased contribution for housing benefits. \nContribution to reduce patients\u2019 co-payments. \nExpansion of Landp\u00edtali\u2019s Grens\u00e1sdeild\nWork on paving connecting roads. \nTemporary contribution for measures to counteract the adverse impact of the pandemic on vulnerable groups. \nIncreased allocation for operation of new nursing home space.\n\nInvestment has increased substantially in recent years and will be above its long-term average in 2023; however, it will contract marginally so as to combat overheating and inflation. Projects include the following: \n\nConstruction of new Landsp\u00edtali hospital; estimated expenditure in 2023: ISK 13.4bn. \nInvestment in transport/traffic structures: ISK 4.9bn.\nInvestment in Digital Iceland and IT projects: ISK 2.5bn. \nContributions to energy transition and green solutions: ISK 1.6bn. \n\nStrong position in choppy global waters\nThe global economic outlook has deteriorated rapidly, not least because of higher energy prices, and there is the risk that the situation will grow even worse in Europe. The impact on Iceland has been limited, as Iceland\u2019s share of renewable energy is among the highest in the world, the fishing industry is strong, and demand for travel to the country is brisk. Tourist numbers are now on a par with the pre-pandemic period. The outlook is for Iceland\u2019s GDP growth to be among the highest in the OECD this year, and for inflation as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) to be the second-lowest in Europe.\nIn order to continue supporting strong social welfare and healthcare systems, it is important not only to bring inflation under control but also to build up fiscal strength for the long term. Iceland looks set to reach a milestone in 2023, in that the ratio of Treasury debt to GDP is expected to decline slightly between years. The successful sale of holdings in \u00cdslandsbanki has played an important role in this. The 57.5% stake sold to date is valued at around ISK 108bn, which slightly exceeds total public investment for 2023.", "id": "8d8063c2c8783a458e82a93ae6b5aaa6"}

At the same time, the economic policy framework had been strengthened considerably,\u201d said Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Bjarni Benediktsson on the Government accounts.\n\u201cThe challenge now is to harness increased economic activity so as to shrink the public sector deficit and halt debt accumulation. We need to slow down spending growth and shore up our foundations once again, both to protect the major advancements of recent years and, no less importantly, to prepare for the challenges of the future. By streamlining operations, utilising new technology, and expanding digitisation, we can take advantage of a welcome opportunity to improve services even further without significant expenditure growth,\u201d said the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs.\nRevenues in 2021\nRevenues excluding financial income increased by ISK 69 billion year-on-year, to a total of ISK 871 billion. The increase stems in particular from taxes and payroll taxes. Among individual types of tax, value-added tax (VAT) stands out, with an increase of ISK 44 billion between years. Revenues from investment tax also increased (ISK 11 billion), as did payroll tax revenues (ISK 9 billion). These three revenue bases were the ones that had contracted the most in 2020. In the case of VAT, year-2021 revenues were far higher than in 2019, the last pre-COVID year, both in absolute terms and as a share of GDP. Bank tax revenues declined by ISK 6 billion year-on-year, while fishing fees increased by ISK 3 billion. Other key tax bases delivered broadly unchanged revenues in absolute terms, although they accounted for a smaller share of GDP. When the results are adjusted to the GFS standard and thereby made comparable to budgetary estimates, revenues from taxes and payroll taxes were ISK 91 billion in excess of budgetary estimates, which were prepared under highly uncertain circumstances in late 2020. The outcome is also ISK 25 billion, or 3.2%, more favourable than the last updated estimates indicated, reflecting, among other things, strong economic activity in Q4.\nOutcome for 2021\nThe outcome for the year was negative by ISK 130 billion, whereas it was negative by ISK 144 billion in 2020. Expenditures before financial items totalled ISK 1,078 billion, an increase of ISK 88 billion year-on-year. Direct pandemic-related expenditures came to ISK 68 billion. Net financial expenses were negative by ISK 60 billion. Asset valuation adjustments totalled ISK 76 billion, owing to adjustments in the value of the holdings in Landsbankinn and \u00cdslandsbanki. These are now assessed at net asset value according to the companies\u2019 year-2021 annual accounts, whereas at the beginning of the year they were assessed at 80% of net asset value. The share in the earnings of Government-owned companies was positive by ISK 61 billion.\nExpenditures for the five largest functions were as follows: hospital services, ISK 108 billion; labour market and unemployment, ISK 97 billion; affairs of the elderly, ISK 92 billion; disability pensions and the affairs of the disabled, ISK 81 billion; and non-hospital healthcare services, ISK 65 billion.\nTotal assets as of end-2021 came to ISK 2,784 billion, while liabilities totalled ISK 2,618 billion and equity totalled ISK 166 billion. The change in the cash position amounted to ISK 15 billion, and the year-end cash position was ISK 381 billion.\nInvestment for the year totalled ISK 67 billion, as compared with ISK 48 billion in 2020 and ISK 43 billion in 2019, an increase of 56% over a two-year period. This increase is part of the broad-based measures undertaken in response to the effects of the pandemic and in a bid to strengthen the employment level.\nYear-2021 outcome exceeds budgetary estimates\nThe operating results in the Government accounts are published on the basis of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), whereas the overall outcome in the fiscal plan and the fiscal budget is presented according to the GFS standard. Both methods are intended to ensure consistency and international comparability. In order to compare the Treasury performance according to the Government accounts with the performance targets in the fiscal plan and the fiscal budget, it is therefore necessary to adjust the outcome of the Government accounts to the GFS. On this basis, it was assumed in the 2021 fiscal budget that the overall outcome would be negative by ISK 326 billion. According to the forecast published in the proposed fiscal budget supplement in December 2021, the outcome was projected to be negative by ISK 294 billion in the last estimate for the year. The outcome proved to be negative by ISK 225 billion, however, an improvement of about one-fourth relative to the December forecast and about one-third relative to the original budgetary estimate. As has previously been discussed, the deviation from the fiscal budget lies mainly in increased revenues, which turned out ISK 109 billion over and above budgetary estimates.\nGoverment Accounts for 2021 (in Icelandic)", "id": "8f69a77c2e393241ac1c77747ad45a6d"}

The general limit on gatherings will be raised from 20 to 50, with ongoing emphasis on distancing and other personal precautions. \nThe new rules will allow fans to attend sporting events and higher number of spectators to attend cultural events, where attendees are seated, face in the same direction, wear facemasks and the opportunities for mingling are reduced.\nThe maximum number of people allowed cultural, religious and sports settings, as well as shops will be 200. Bars and restaurants can stay open until 23:00, and capacity restrictions at public swimming pools and gyms have been loosened.\nThis is done considering the favourable epidemiological trend in the past few months. The current 14-day domestic incidence rate is 1.4 per 100 thousand inhabitants. Most domestic infections identified in the past few weeks have been due to old and inactive infections.\n\"We are in a gradual phase of easing restrictions and slowly but surely returning to normalcy. This good progress is the result of widespread public participation in our common quest to minimize the harmful effects of the pandemic on our society. The ongoing effort to protect the most vulnerable parts of our society will result in a changed evaluation of the risk posed to us by the pandemic. Until those effects materialize, we will maintain proper vigilance both domestically and at the border,\" says Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, Prime Minister of Iceland.\nIceland's response to the pandemic has been based on the best available scientific knowledge. \"We were among the first to start focused quarantine for passengers arriving from high-risk areas. Since then, our strategy of early detection, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine has been the cornerstone of our approach. The success of these efforts has made it unnecessary for us to impose complete lockdowns during the pandemic. We are still far from having a normal situation, but we are moving fast in the right direction,\" says Svand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir, Minister of Health.\nToday also marks a significant milestone for schooling at the secondary level. While schooling has been close to normal for students under 16, some restrictions have been in place for secondary schools and tertiary education has mostly been moved online. As of tomorrow, a general limit of 150 people within confined areas will apply to higher level schooling, including universities. A one-meter distancing rule will apply in schools and masks will only be required where it is not possible to guarantee the distancing rule.\n\"Today marks a very joyous turning point for our schools. Teachers and students have shown great patience and perseverance during this past year. We hope that all of our hard work is now starting to pay off,\" says Lilja D. Alfredsd\u00f3ttir, Minister of Education and Culture.\nCurrently 17 individuals are in isolation with an infection, 24 are in quarantine due to suspected exposure, one person is hospitalized with an active infection.\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, every positive sample of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been sequenced by Icelandic biotech firm, deCode Genetics. Through these efforts it has been established that most of domestic transmission since 15 September are due to a particular variant of the virus, but all other variants, including B.1.1.7. have been contained at the border.\nIceland has announced that from 1 May it will use the ECDC risk assessment colour code at the border. From that time travellers from low-risk areas will be exempt from quarantine measures if they present a negative PCR result at the border. Currently, a negative PCR test is required prior to departure when travelling to Iceland. Additionally, a PCR test is mandatory\u00a0at the border followed by a five-day quarantine and a second test.

As for schools, the proximity limits at all school levels will go from 2 metres to 1 metre, and children in preschools and primary schools will again be able to partake in organised sports, youth and recreational activities. This is the gist of the relaxation of the disease prevention rules that were announced by the Minister of Health in the government\u2019s meeting today, in keeping with the recommendations of the Chief Epidemiologist. Regulations on the changes are being drawn up and will be published later today. They are expected to remain in place for 3 weeks.\nThe Chief Epidemiologist\u2019s memorandum states that the daily number of infections has diminished since the last tightening of restrictions at the borders. These included requiring sampling for children and for travellers carrying proof of vaccination or prior infection, and increased monitoring of those who are under quarantine or in isolation. This has been effective in preventing a more extensive group infection or the spread of infections. However, the Chief Epidemiologist points out that the virus has not been eliminated from the community. We must continue to be extra careful because of the extensive spread of the disease in the neighbouring countries and the new variants of the virus. The key to the relaxation of local restrictions is to take the utmost care at the borders.\nThe situation in the hospitals is good. Only one patient is currently hospitalised with COVID-19 and, as the Chief Epidemiologist points out, over 90% of the people 70 years and older have been vaccinated. However, he wishes to emphasise that the relaxation of restrictions should be done slowly while we are getting to grips with infections at the borders and increasing the number of vaccinated persons.\u00a0\nThe main changes to the common restrictions on gatherings:\nBroadly, the restrictions on gatherings will be the same as the restrictions in force from 5 February. Keep in mind the importance of respecting disease prevention measures and following the rules.\n\nThe common restrictions on numbers will be 20 persons.\nPublic swimming pools, health centres and gyms are permitted to admit 50% of the permitted maximum number of guests, subject to the other conditions.\nSports training and competitions are permitted for both children and adults, both with and without physical contact, but without audiences. The maximum number of adults will be 50 persons, but the number of children will follow the same restrictions as those for schools.\nSki areas are permitted to admit 50% of the maximum capacity of each area.\nStage arts, including choir activities, are permitted with up to 50 persons together on stage and an audience of 100 seated persons in each compartment, subject to the other conditions.\nThe maximum number of people taking part in the activities of religious and philosophical organisations will continue to be 30; however, 100 persons will be permitted at funerals.\nAll shops will be permitted to receive 5 customers per every 10 m2, however no more than 100 persons at a time, in addition to 20 employees in the same space as the customers.\nClubs, bars, amusement arcades and slot machines are permitted to open, subject to the same restrictions as restaurants serving alcohol.\nPractical driving lessons and flight training with an instructor are permitted.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChanges to school activities:\nThe Ministry of Health is working on a new regulation on restrictions to school activities as of 15 April, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.

The publication is the first report by the committee and addresses economic, environmental, regional and demographic developments and challenges of the Icelandic society over the next 15\u201320 years.\nKatr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, Prime Minister of Iceland, appointed the Future Committee in mid-2018 to discuss challenges and opportunities of new technologies. The Committee is comprised of 11 Members of Parliament and has, among other things, the responsibilities to discuss the development of trends that could shape or impact the society in the future, especially in environmental issues and demographic factors.\nMain conclusions and recommendations of the Committee are as follows:\n\nThe feasibility of a more flexible education system should be analysed, in particular if core education and continuing education should be merged into a single flexible educational system.\nThe need for human resources and skills must be analysed on a regular basis.\nLegislation needs to keep abreast of developments in the labour market and the gig economy, so that individuals\u2019 rights are protected without compromising innovation.\nGovernment revenue generation must be subject to continuous review in light of changed tax bases, increased globalisation, and changes in the labour market.\nEconomic diversity and sustainable resource utilisation are key elements to ensure stability in the long run.\nThe impact of automation on rural areas and on fragile communities must be explored.\nChanges in the age distribution of the population and changes in cross border migration create societal challenges that need to be addressed.\n\nThe report states that the Future Committee considers it important for the government to take these proposals into consideration as minor changes in the present may prevent major changes in the future. The report further states that any changes ahead can lead to different scenarios in the future depending on how society will react to them. The report identifies which external driving forces are likely to have a significant impact on the development of Iceland in the coming decades, both with positive and negative consequences. Government action will have a great influence on how society will develop.\nMajor changes can be expected in the coming decades. Scenarios indicate that 2040 is likely to see an increase in tourist arrivals despite a temporary decline in 2019. Immigration is also likely to increase. Icelandic software production will strengthen, and there will be more food production in greenhouses. It is expected that there will be far more rapid changes in the market and a significant increase in the number of small businesses, self-employed persons and teleworkers can be expected. An increase in the use of sustainable energy can be expected to slow down and the country's oldest energy resources are even exhausting. Along with climate change, fishing may decline by as much as a third in 2040.\nFurther information on the content and results of the report is provided by Sm\u00e1ri McCarthy, Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Committee.\nSummary in English: Icelandic society 2035\u20132040 Economic, environmental, regional, and demographic developments", "id": "9617c512c1b33859a0d11226e57dbb31"}

Trade and economic relations between the states were a focal point as well. \n\u201cThe United States are our largest and most important market and therefore it was very significant to sense during the meeting the mutual willingness to deepen the trade relationship between our countries even further,\u201d said Foreign Minister Th\u00f3rdarson. The annual bilateral economic dialogue between Iceland and the United States has been firmly established and hopefully the so-called Iceland bill, which will improve access of Icelandic investors and businesspeople to the US market, will soon be approved in Congress. Secretary Blinken and Minister Th\u00f3rdarson also agreed on strengthening tourism between the two states once the pandemic is over. \nFurthermore, Blinken and Th\u00f3rdarson discussed the situation in international affairs, not least the conflict in the Middle East.

These measures are taken in response to two clusters of infections that have been identified in the past few days, one of which has not been traced to a definite source. \n\"In late February Iceland was among the first countries in Europe to institute a policy of quarantine, isolation, high-volume testing and contact tracing. This policy served us well and the measures we are introducing now are intended to have the effect of sparing us the need for more drastic restrictions later,\" says Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir. \u201cHowever, if further steps need to be taken, we will not hesitate to take them in order to protect public health and our healthcare infrastructure. As before, we rely on the active co-operation and responsible behaviour of the general population and naturally, this extends to everyone who is visiting Iceland. We all need to do our share in limiting the risk of further spread of the virus by respecting the social distancing rules and practicing thorough hand-washing, and other precautions.\"\nThe new restrictions reimpose a 100-person limit of larger gatherings and reinstate the 2-meter social distancing rule. This applies to all businesses, workplaces, and public establishments. Where the 2-meter rule cannot be respected masks should be used, such as on domestic flights and ferries, in hair salons, massage parlours and other personal service establishments. All businesses and establishments open to the public must provide hand sanitizers, regularly clean, and disinfect the premises and equipment. Museums, clubs, and other establishments open to the public, where the 2-meter rule cannot be maintained, should temporarily halt their operations. Bars and restaurants must close by 11 PM as before. \nSince Iceland started offering border screening, almost 60 thousand people have been tested for the virus upon arrival in Iceland. Since 13 July, Icelanders and those living in Iceland have had to take special precautions\u00a0for the first five days after arriving in Iceland and undergo a second PCR-test to minimize the risk of a false negative causing infection to spread in the community. As of tomorrow, all those arriving in Iceland from high-risk areas who intend to stay in Iceland for 10 days or more, will have to take the same precautions and undergo a second test. In their recommendation, the Chief Epidemiologist and his deputy, highlight that further measures might need to be taken at the border at a later stage, should the number of infections continue to grow rapidly.\n\u201cTo minimize the risk of further spread within the community, we rely on the tools that served us well so far, namely early testing, contact tracing, quarantining of at-risk individuals and targeted social distancing measures. We always expected that a small number of infections might pop up from time to time, and we have all the mechanisms in place to tackle such cases,\u201d says Thorolfur Gudnason, Chief Epidemiologist. \nSince 23 July, 28 domestic infections have been diagnosed in Iceland raising the incidence of domestic infections to 7.1 per 100 thousand inhabitants over the last 14 days. The incidence of infections diagnosed through border screening is 2.5 per 100 thousand inhabitants over the last 14 days. So far, one person has been hospitalized and the ambulatory remote care unit has been reactivated to care for those infected.\nA total of 1 872 individuals have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in Iceland.

The regulation is intended to promote improved air quality in harbours and coastal areas and conforms with the government\u2019s coalition agreement and climate action plan.\nThe change is brought about by an amendment to the regulation on sulphur content of certain liquid fuels. The permissible sulphur content of marine fuels used in the territorial sea and internal waters of Iceland will be lowered from 3.5% down to 0.1% on January 1, 2020. This will make requirements for the sulphur content of marine fuels in the territorial seas of Iceland comparable with those that are currently in effect in Emission Control Areas as defined by Annex VI of MARPOL, where particularly strict requirements apply. \nIn addition, on January 1 2020, the permissible sulphur content of marine fuels will be lowered down to 0.5% within the Icelandic Pollution Prevention Zone but outside of the territorial sea. This is in conformity with the requirements of Regulation No. 124/2015 on the sulphur content on certain liquid fuels and Iceland\u2019s international obligations according to Annex VI of the MARPOL convention which Iceland ratified in February 2018.\nThis will make the permissible sulphur content in marine fuels in Iceland 0.1% in the territorial sea and internal waters, i.e. also in fjords and bays. Further out to sea and outside of territorial waters, the sulphur content cannot exceed 0.5%. Heavy fuel oil has a higher sulphur content than this in most cases, and thus the regulation effectively brings a halt to the use of heavy fuel oil around Iceland. For comparison, the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil marketed in Iceland in 2017 ranged from 0.64%\u20131.94% but the global average according to data from the IMO was 2.59%.\nVessels can, however, continue to burn heavy fuel oil if they use approved emission abatement methods to reduce the release of sulphur dioxide, which prevents most sulphur emissions into the atmosphere along with soot pollution. \nA draft regulation was introduced earlier this year and consultations were held with stakeholders and interested parties before its adoption.", "id": "98f9ce91de0734e1875e837411dc37d7"}

Minister of Health Svand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir announced this morning that requirements to wear masks, socially distance and restrict gatherings would be fully lifted.\n\u201cWe are regaining the kind of society which we feel normal to live in and we have longed for, ever since the authorisations of the Act on Health Security and Communicable Diseases to restrict gatherings were activated because of the pandemic more than a year ago, on the 16th of March 2020\u201d, said the Minister of Health Svand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir. The decision to lift all gathering restrictions is in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief Epidemiologist.\nAbout 87 per cent of Icelandic residents eligible to be vaccinated have received at least one dose of vaccine, while circa 60 percent are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Everyone that had not previously been offered vaccination should have received an invitation to arrange one at this point. Government plans for the vaccination programme and the lifting of restrictions on gatherings have therefore been completed. \nDomestic restrictions due to COVID-19 have varied during the pandemic in accordance with the circumstances. Requirements on social distancing and restrictions on gatherings have been in force the entire period and varying requirements to wear masks have been in force since autumn 2020. \u00a0The restrictions have resulted in limitations for a range of activities and occasional suspension of activities.\nCultural activities, sports, the operation of schools, restaurants, travel services and many more activities have been affected by the rules on restrictions of gatherings applicable at each time. However, most pre-school and primary education has continued on site during the pandemic, as it has been a priority and judged to be relatively low-risk.\nA policy of widespread and early testing, contact tracing, quarantine of suspected contacts and isolation of known cases has been in place since the beginning of the pandemic. More than 60 per cent of domestic cases were individuals who were already in quarantine at the time of diagnosis.\nCommunication to the public has been led by the Chief Epidemiologist, the head of civil protection and the surgeon general, who have held press briefings, almost on a daily basis for parts of the crisis. \"Continuous and honest communication between the people and our trusted scientists have contributed mightily to the population's willingness to take part in the effort to minimize the harms of the pandemic. There has been a focus on maintaining a proper level of vigilance, without either downplaying or exaggerating the risk. We are succeeding by trusting the good sense of the Icelandic people,\" says Svavarsd\u00f3ttir.\n\"When we have found sporadic cases, our process has been to test aggressively and ask large groups of likely contacts to quarantine. So far this year, this has been sufficiently effective to surpress\u00a0 small clusters before they can \u00a0grow into full-blown waves of infection.\n\u201cWe fully expect that we will continue to detect cases and that small clusters of infection may appear. But we are confident that our contact tracing capabilities, with the public's willingness to abide by both quarantine and isolation requirements, will prove sufficient to handle any new outbreaks,\" says V\u00ed\u00f0ir Reynisson, Head of Civil Protection.\nIn 2021 most of the diagnosed domestic cases have been the Alpha variant (often referred to as the Kent or British variant). \"The contact tracing and quarantine efforts here in Iceland seem to have contained its transmission to a similar level as the original variant, with slightly more than 5 percent of quarantined individuals turning out to have been infected regardless of which sub-type of the virus we have been dealing with,\" says Thorolfur Gudnason, chief epidemiologist.\nCurrently 12 individuals are in isolation due to an infection. Throughout the pandemic a total of 6 637 domestic cases have been identified. 30 individuals in Iceland have died because of COVID-19. One fatality due to the disease has occurred in Iceland in 2021.\nOn the 1st of July, amended rules on testing at the borders will enter into force.\u00a0\nThe borders: The testing of children and people with vaccination certificates or certificates of prior infections will be stopped\nThe Minister of Health has decided to amend the disease prevention rules at the borders applicable as of the 1st of July to the 15th of August.\n\nOn the 1st of July testing of those who submit valid vaccination certificates with vaccines approved by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and/or by WHO will be stopped.

The basis for this is that the incidence rate alone does not give a satisfactory picture of the prevalence of community infections, because if the ratio of positive samples is high, this indicates that community infections are more widespread than the incidence rate shows.\n\nThe effects of the amendments\n\nThe number of countries on the list of high-risk areas grows significantly. The main reason is that countries with an incidence rate of less than 500 but a 5% ratio or higher of positive samples are added to the list.\n\nMandatory quarantine in a quarantine facility: Passengers arriving from a country or region where the incidence rate of infection is 700 or higher, must unconditionally quarantine in a quarantine facility. This also applies if the incidence rate of infection is between 500-699 and the ratio of positive samples is 5% or higher, or if the incidence rate is over 500 but satisfactory information on the ratio of positive samples is not available. An exception from this requirement is only granted if there are pressing reasons to do so, such as the individual\u2019s disability, level of mental development or other comparable reasons.\nQuarantine requirement in a quarantine facility with the possibility of exemption: Passengers arriving from a country where the incidence rate of infection is between 500-699 and the ratio of positive samples is lower than 5% are required to quarantine in a quarantine facility but can apply for an exemption from the requirement. The same applies to those arriving from places where the incidence rate of infection is under 500 but the ratio of positive samples is 5% or higher or information on the ratio of positive samples is not available. Applicants for an exemption shall adequately demonstrate that they will fulfil all conditions for quarantining in a facility they have arranged. You can register a request for an exemption when pre-registering at visit.covid.is\u00a048-72 hours. before arriving in the country.\u00a0\nCertification of vaccination or prior infection: As before, those who submit a vaccination certificate or a certificate of a prior infection will only be required to undergo one test upon arrival in the country. It is important that they not interact with others and follow quarantine rules while they await the test results.\n\nThe Faroe Islands and Greenland: Passengers from the Faroe Islands will be exempt from measures to contain the spread of infections at the border as of 10 May and are not required to submit certificates nor undergo testing and quarantine. This already applies to passengers from Greenland. Those two countries will then be the only countries on the Chief Epidemiologist\u2019s list of low-risk areas.\n\n\nAdvertisement No. 487/2021 regarding regions and countries that are considered to be special high-risk areas for COVID-19 (enters into force on 7 May)\n\n\n\nCOVID-19, granice: zmienione kryteria definiowania obszar\u00f3w wysokiego ryzyka", "id": "9d89f5772bf13593bf85acb166470f99"}

For older pupils, the same restrictions will apply to music lessons as to upper-secondary schools.\n\nIn his memorandum to the Minister of Health, the Chief Epidemiologist pointed out that the stage has been reached when the pandemic has been brought under reasonable control; nevertheless developments over the past few days suggest that it may be on the increase. In the light of this, the situation may be rather different at the beginning of the new school term in January, which may entail a revision of the regulations.

The general limit on the number of persons in a gathering will continue to be 20, but with more exceptions than have been allowed up to now. The 2-metre social distancing rule and the obligation to wear face-masks remain in place. Night-clubs, bars, gaming establishments and slot-machines can open again, subject to certain conditions. Audience numbers attending stage performances will rise from 100 to 150, and religious and life-stance associations will be permitted to hold ceremonies, including funerals, attended by a maximum of 150 guests. The maximum number of customers permitted in shops will be 150, taking account of the floor area; the same will apply to visitors to museums and galleries. Fitness centres will be permitted to open their changing facilities again, and guests will be able to use their exercise equipment, subject to certain restrictions. A new regulation allowing for these changes has been issued and will remain in force until 3 March 2021.\n\nIt had been planned that no change to the previous regulation would be made before 18 February; however, in his memorandum to the minister, the Chief Epidemiologist explained that in view of the great decline in the incidence of COVID-19 in Iceland he considered an early easing of the restrictions to be justified. Nevertheless, he stressed the need for continued vigilance and caution until the stage is reached when vaccination against COVID-19 has reached more people.\u00a0\n\nCatering establishments with alcohol licences, including restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars and night-clubs, may not remain open after 10 p.m. The same applies to gaming establishment and slot-machine saloons.

The Minister of Health has approved a regulation to that effect. The regulation gives individuals in isolation limited authorisation to pursue outdoor activities.\u00a0\nSpecial precautions against infection\nThe changes to the rules on special\u00a0precautions against infection are made in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief Epidemiologist. In the Chief Epidemiologist's memorandum to the minister, it is noted that in the first 16 days of the year only around 1% of those required to exercise personal precautions against infection were diagnosed with Covid following a test. A large part of that group were school-age children.\nAs before, the contact tracing team will evaluate who will be required to quarantine and who will be required to exercise special\u00a0precautions based on the exposure to infection in each case. Those evaluated to have had negligible exposure are subject to unchanged rules of personal precautions with the exception that the precautionary period now lasts for 7 days and a test is no longer required at the beginning and end. If an individual exercising special\u00a0precaution feels Covid-like symptoms, they shall undergo a PCR test.\nThose exercising special\u00a0precautions can go to work, school and run necessary errands. They have to keep in mind that an infection is possible, show caution, observe personal infection prevention measures and go get a PCR test immediately if they experience symptoms. When exercising special\u00a0precautions interactions with vulnerable individuals and groups must be avoided.\u00a0\nOutdoor activities during isolation\nUnder the current rules, individuals in isolation due to Covid-19 may go out on balconies or out into private yards if they are healthy enough to do so. The changes decided by the Minister of Health allow such individuals to take a walk in the area around their homes if they are able. They have to maintain a distance of 2 meters from other pedestrians and avoid crowded areas. They can take two such walks per day lasting 30 minutes each at the most.

They receive training in clothing manufacturing with financial independence as the guiding principle. They learn to reuse materials and thereby strengthen the circular economy within the SADA center that houses them. This cooperation project is the first of its kind in Turkey and is being operated in cooperation with UN Women, and UN Women in Iceland will be contributing to the project and monitoring it.\nMinister \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Kolbr\u00fan stated that the contribution of 66\u00b0North and UN Women in Iceland illustrates what companies and civil society organisations in Iceland are capable of when it comes to development cooperation. \u201cMost of the refugee women have lost their spouses and are the breadwinners of their households. They are in distress and their rights are limited. This project generates revenue for the ongoing activities of the SADA Centre, which is their sole source of revenue, support network and shelter,\u201d stated \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Kolbr\u00fan at the signing of the agreement.\n\u201cIt is a real pleasure to see this partnership with UN Women and the SADA Center become a reality that would not have been possible without support from the Sustainable Development Goals Partnership Fund,\u201d says Bjarney Har\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir of 66\u00b0North. The company has always had equality and sustainability at the forefront and the circular economy is the guiding principle for the business where we reuse and give leftover materials a new life. In this project, we are supporting the empowerment of refugee women, while at the same time promoting sustainability,\u201d Bjarney stated.\n\u201cA cooperative project like this, involving the government, private companies, NGOs and an international organisation, is a new and incredibly exciting opportunity for UN Women in Iceland,\u201d says Stella Sam\u00faelsd\u00f3ttir, the executive director of UN Women in Iceland. The project directly affects the employment opportunities of refugee women and contributes to their financial independence and the development of a circular economy. I hope that the project will provide incentives for other companies to participate in development cooperation and humanitarian projects, while also strengthening the sustainability and financial independence of women and girls around the world. We at UN Women in Iceland are very grateful for the support of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and 66\u00b0North and are very much looking forward to the cooperation for the next three years,\u201d Stella stated.\nThe project fits well with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, including the Goals for gender equality (Goal No 5), decent work and economic growth (Goal No 8), innovation and infrastructure (Goal No 9) and partnerships for the goals (Goal No 17).\nThe Sustainable Development Goals Partnership Fund supports companies that are interested in contributing to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals by entering cooperation projects in developing States.

It measures the extend of gender-based gaps in 153 countries among four key dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.\nThe report gives countries a score where 100 is complete gender parity. Iceland remains at the top of the list for the 11th year running with 87.7 points, an improvement by 0.02 since last year.

This is an important acknowledgement of the progress made, which can to a great extent be attributed to the robust women\u2019s movement, but also targeted social infrastructure investments. That includes universal, affordable childcare and well-funded parental leave for mothers and fathers, both of which have been instrumental for gender equality at work and at home. Yet, there are numerous remaining challenges to fully close the gender gap, as statistics on gender-based violence clearly demonstrate. Violence against women is both the cause and the consequence of wider gender inequalities. This is a government priority.

NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller and Gudlaugur Th\u00f3r Th\u00f3rdarson, Iceland\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs, gave the opening speeches at the beginning of the conference yesterday.\u00a0\nIn his speech,\u00a0Th\u00f3rdarson declared his support for further disarmament efforts. \u201cThere is an urgent need to apply more energy, more creative thinking and even more resources to the disarmament and arms control efforts, not only as regards weapons of mass destruction but also on conventional weapons, emerging technologies and hybrid threats.\u201d\nAt the same time, Th\u00f3rdarson emphasised the importance of supporting existing treaties. \u201cIceland considers that the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty should continue to be the cornerstone of disarmament efforts in the nuclear field. If we are ever to reach the goal of nuclear weapons free world, the countries which have nuclear arsenals must commit and those outside join the treaty. Under current circumstances the international community should limit its ambition to safeguarding the existing commitments.\u201d\nToday, the Institute of International Affairs of the University of Iceland hosts a seminar\u00a0in conjunction with the annual NATO conference. The seminar, which is held in collaboration with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Prime Minister, will address the actions of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and international cooperation, including the role of non-governmental organizations.", "id": "a30dfccbbca633f59bcda998061ab8f5"}

The most prominent risk factor, although it is unlikely to materialise in the near future, is high real prices in the real estate market. The likelihood of overheating in the economy has subsided from the perceived risk level in the summer. In global markets, volatility has been at a minimum while asset prices are at a maximum, and conditions could change suddenly. In Iceland, this risk would surface, in part, in more expensive funding for the banks. In general, however, the banks are very resilient, their capital position is sound and their liquidity strong, and stress tests indicate that they could withstand severe strain. If planned dividend payments take place, they will reduce the banks\u2019 resilience, other things being equal, and supervisory authorities must therefore monitor them closely. \nThe chair of the Systemic Risk Committee gave a short presentation on several highlights from the findings of the risk assessment group on financial market infrastructure, which were presented to the SRC at its December meeting. The points covered were renewal of financial market infrastructure, settlement arrangements for debit cards, and acquirers\u2019 counterparty risk. At present, the real-time gross settlement and netting systems are being renewed, as are the trading systems of the banks themselves and the Central Bank\u2019s trading system. These changes are accompanied by considerable strain and potential contagion. Furthermore, a significant counterparty risk materialised for one acquirer last year. \n2.\tOfficial Financial Stability Council policy on the countercyclical capital buffer and introduction of systemic risk buffer early in 2019\nA draft of the Financial Stability Council\u2019s official policy on the countercyclical capital buffer, prepared by the Systemic Risk Committee, was presented. Furthermore, factors that must be considered in connection with the review of the systemic risk buffer before the Financial Stability Council\u2019s next meeting were discussed. The European Systemic Risk Board has discussed capital buffers, the interactions among them, and experience gained from applying them. \n3.\tOther business\na.\tBrief discussion of the Nordic-Baltic Stability Group.

Until now, this exemption has only applied to those presenting certificates from the EU/EEA Area but will now apply equally to everyone who can provide proof of a full vaccination with a vaccine that has been certified for use by the European Medical Agency as well as requirements defined by the Chief Epidemiologist of Iceland and Icelandic regulations.\u00a0Certificates from the the World Health Organization (WHO) (the International Certificate of Vaccination or the Carte Jaune/Yellow Card) are also accepted for vaccines the WHO has validated.\u00a0\nThe exemption also applies to those who can provide valid proof of prior infection. Documentation on prior infections must be in accordance with the requirements defined by the Chief Epidemiologist.\n\u201cThe world has been through a lot in the past twelve months, and we are all hoping for a slow and safe return to normalcy. This also includes the resumption of the opportunity to travel, which is valuable to culture, trade and enterprise. The decision to apply border exemptions for vaccinated individuals to countries outside the EU/EEA area is a logical extension of our current policy,\u201d says Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, Prime Minister of Iceland.\nIceland has maintained a policy of exempting EU/EEA citizens with prior infection, as well as those who are fully vaccinated, from all border measures. \"Our experience and data so far indicate very strongly that there is very little risk of infection stemming from individuals who have acquired immunity against the disease, either by vaccination or by prior infection. When people are protected against the same disease, with the same vaccines that are produced by the same companies, there is no medical reason to discriminate on the basis of the location where the jab is administered. Our experience shows that the risk of infection from vaccinated individuals is very small or negligible.\" says Th\u00f3r\u00f3lfur Gudnason Chief Epidemiologist.\u00a0\nIceland has announced that from 1 May it will use the ECDC risk assessment colour code at the border. From that time travellers from low-risk areas (green and yellow) will be exempt from quarantine measures if they present a negative PCR result at the border.\nSince 16 February, a negative PCR test is required prior to departure when travelling to Iceland. Additionally, a PCR test is mandatory at the border followed by a five-day quarantine and a second test. Vaccinated individuals and those with prior infection are exempt from the measures.\nCurrently 30 individuals are in isolation with an infection, 24 are in quarantine due to suspected exposure. No one is hospitalized due to COVID-19 in Iceland.\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, every positive sample of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been sequenced by Icelandic biotech firm, deCode Genetics. Through these efforts it has been established that most of domestic transmission since 15 September are due to a particular variant of the virus, but all other variants, including B.1.1.7. have been contained at the border.\nPlease note that travel to Iceland from outside the EEA/Schengen area is still restricted.\u00a0 However, on March 26 a government regulation will come into effect that allows non-essential travels to Iceland from outside the EEA/Schengen-area for passengers who can provide valid proof of vaccination or prior infection, in addition to those on essential business.\n\n\nFurther information on certificates of vaccination against COVID-19 accepted at the border\nFurther information on certificates regarding previous COVID-19 infection that are accepted at the border in Iceland\n\nThis press release has been amended since its original publication.", "id": "a42771cd3c3935d59888d250cde83e89"}

Those who provide valid proof of having been vaccinated against COVID-19 are not required to provide a PCR-test prior to boarding and are also exempt from screening and quarantine measures at the border. The same applies to those who can provide proof of prior infection.\nA new regulation on border measures also includes provisions that require individuals to isolate in managed isolation facilities (quarantine hotels) if the first border test is positive and the infected individual is unable to provide credible plans for self-managed isolation. The requirement for isolation in a managed facility may also apply to individuals who are infected with virus strains that are classified by the Chief Epidemiologist as particularly worrisome in terms of contagion and morbidity. These measures were introduced to the Icelandic cabinet by the Minister of Health earlier today. The stricter measures are based on recommendations by the Chief Epidemiologist. \nPrime Minister of Iceland, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir said: \"By requiring every passenger to present a negative PCR test prior to boarding we are reducing the likelihood of a person starting a journey while unknowingly infected by the virus. Many countries in Europe have already introduced similar measures and we have already announced plans to allow travellers from low-risk countries to bypass quarantine measures from 1 May on the condition that they present a negative PCR test prior to boarding. We believe that requiring a negative PCR test prior to boarding is an effective and proportional requirement, especially in light of the fact that people now have good access to such testing in most countries in Europe.\"\nThe current levels of COVID-19 in Iceland are low and are being closely monitored, with only one active infection having been diagnosed domestically in a person outside quarantine since 20 January. The domestic 14-day incidence rate stands at 1.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. 24 people are currently in-home isolation with an active infection, none over the age of 60.\nMinister of Health, Svand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir said: \"We view these tighter control measures as a way to allow us to ease the domestic measures sooner and allow us to start taking gradual steps towards normalcy, while maintaining utmost caution. This is a delicate balance, as easing of domestic measures increases the risks associated with imported cases. However, we have had very good experience with our current system of double screening so any additional layer of risk reduction will give us increased confidence.\"\n\nAircraft and ship operators carrying passengers to Iceland are obliged to present securely to their passengers the requirement to fill out a pre-registration form in due time before arrival to Iceland. It must also be ensured that quarantine requirements have been presented securely to travellers that have already booked tickets to Iceland. The requirements should also be available for all travellers booking tickets to Iceland, including on booking sites. Aircraft and ship operators are urged to inform their passengers on the requirement to fill out a pre-registration prior departure to Iceland, on the contract tracing app, Rakning C-19, and about www.covid.is/english where they will find useful information in 8 foreign languages.\nThe Icelandic government is asking airlines and other air service operators transporting passengers to Iceland for their assistance inspecting passengers\u2019 negative PCR-test certificates before boarding at the point of departure. Airline/transportation staff are not required to verify the validity of the certificates. No fines or other sanctions will be imposed on airlines/operators at this stage.

The changes involved will take effect on 18 November 2020. The main changes are that sporting, youth and leisure activities for children in pre-schools (kindergartens) and compulsory junior schools (to age 16) will be permitted once again. In upper-secondary schools, the number of persons permitted to gather in one space will be raised to 25. Services of various types which entail physical contact or close proximity will be permitted again. The general limit on the size of gatherings to 10 persons will continue. It is envisaged that further relaxation of the restrictions will be possible at the beginning of December.\nIn his memorandum to the minister, the Chief Epidemiologist proposed that gradual relaxations be made in the coming weeks. Those that take effect on Wednesday, 18 November, are as follows:\n\nActivities and services that entail physical contact between people will be permitted, with the condition that they use face masks. This applies, for example, to hairdressers, massage parlours, driving and flying instructors and others offering comparable services. A maximum of 10 customers at a time will be apply in the premises of these establishments. \nRehearsals, sporting activities and youth and leisure activities for children of kindergarten and junior school age (to age 16) will be permitted, both indoors and out of doors. To make it possible for such activities to take place, there will be no restrictions regarding the mixing of groups. Maximum numbers of persons in each space shall be according to the regulation on number restrictions in schools. Up to 50 children of kindergarten age and in the first four grades of junior school may occupy the same space; for those in Grades 5-10, the maximum will be 25.\nIn the upper-secondary schools, a maximum of 25 pupils and staff may occupy each space instead of the 10 permitted previously; however, face masks must be used and the 2-metre social distance rule must be observed.\nExemptions from face-mask requirements are permitted in the case of persons who are unable to use them, for example due to health reasons or because they lack the maturity or understanding required to wear masks. Persons who have had COVID-19 are also exempt from the face-mask requirement if they are able to demonstrate this by means of a valid medical certificate.\n\nThe changes to the regulations laying down restrictions on gatherings and school activities due to the pandemic take effect on 18 November 2020.

The purpose of the Fund will primarily be to serve as a sort of disaster relief reserve for the nation, when the Treasury suffers a financial blow in connection with severe, unforeseen shocks to the national economy, either due to a plunge in revenues or the cost of relief measures that the government has considered unavoidable to undertake. This refers to disruptions which occur very rarely but, as history shows, can strike at intervals of several decades, such as major natural catastrophes which could result in extensive damages to settlements, transport infrastructure or hydroelectric power plants and power-intensive industry, ecosystemdisasters, epidemic diseases or other shocks, causing huge economic damage beyond what is insured by other means, such as through Natural Catastrophe Insurance of Iceland. Examples of such major events occurring in the past include natural catastrophes such as the Skaft\u00e1reldar eruptions and the ensuing M\u00f3\u00f0uhar\u00f0indi famine (1783-85) or the Westman Islands eruption (1973), ecosystem failures such as the collapse of the herring stock (1969) or an epidemic such as the Spanish flu (1918). It could also include events or circumstances of a completely different nature, such as the consequences of large-scale cyberattacks on the country\u2019s key infrastructure or acts of terrorism.\nThese could comprise shocks that the Treasury, as things currently stand, lacks sufficient financial strength to withstand without causing significant debilitating impacts on the social welfare of the natinon as a result of cutbacks to public services, or which would impose a debt burden that would be onerous for a long period or even unsustainable. Therefore the legislation is based on the long-term perspective of creating a very substantial fund, which could respond to the consequences of major unforeseen and rare shocks to public finances, rather than having the fund itself directly finance compensation, e.g. for damages suffered by specific industrial sectors or groups.\nThe state's contributions to the Fund will be equivalent to new revenues from publicly owned power production companies which are expected to accrue in the coming years.\nOn the government\u2018s website, samradsgatt.is, the government\u2018s intent for legislation has been published in Icelandic.\nEnglish translation of the intention document", "id": "a5736d7fb8ed394c8a5e9c4fe27ab3e4"}

A unanimous decision to that effect was taken today at a meeting of the Committee of Ministers.\n\u201eThe Council of Europe is about the core values of our societies; democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, and economic hardships pose challenges to these core values and it has therefore never been more important for European leaders to renew their commitment and unite around safeguarding these values. Iceland will take its presiding role seriously, as we are assuming this task in difficult times,\u201c said Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir.\nOnly three Summits of the Council of Europe have been held in the nearly 75-year history of the Council. The Summit will be the largest meeting of its kind ever hosted by Iceland.\n\u201eIceland will of course respond to the call of European countries to convene the leaders,\u201c said \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Kolbr\u00fan Reykfj\u00f6r\u00f0 Gylfad\u00f3ttir, Minister for Foreign Affairs. \u201eIt is clear that the situation that has arisen on the continent following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will be the focus of the Summit. The conditions for holding such a meeting could hardly be more pressing and the eyes of the world will no doubt be directed at Iceland during these days this coming spring.\u201c\nIceland will take over the Presidency of the Council of Europe from Ireland on November 9. The Presidency will emphasise the core values of the Council of Europe \u2013 human rights, democracy and the rule of law. In addition, the Icelandic government\u2019s focus on equality, matters concerning children and environmental issues is reflected in the programme for the Icelandic Presidency. A number of events will be held in connection with the Presidency over the next six months both in Strasbourg and in Iceland, where emphasis will be placed on presenting Icelandic solutions to common challenges.", "id": "a9c9ce98ac65366db565dfe13792c8e4"}

{"date": "November 30, 2021", "title": "Fiscal policy statement 2022-2026", "content": "The Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs will introduce a proposal for a parliamentary resolution on the fiscal policy statement for 2022-2026 before Parliament today. According to the Act on Public Finances, the strategy must be introduced no later than at the time the new Government\u2019s fiscal budget proposal is introduced.\nThe guiding principle underlying the fiscal strategy is to halt the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio no later than 2026. Public debt is positioned to be far lower by the end of the fiscal policy horizon than was feared at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This significantly improved debt position, which is due to the strong rebound in the economy and the sale of Government holdings in \u00cdslandsbanki, provides the scope needed to achieve the objective of halting debt accumulation one year later than originally planned. \nThe aim is to ensure the financial resilience of the public sector and shore up the Government\u2019s ability to mitigate the impact of economic shocks on households and businesses while simultaneously safeguarding public services and transfer systems. This also builds up the flexibility to meet increased expenditures due to the foreseen aging of the population. In the short term, the goal will be to support the economy until it has regained a strong footing.\nFiscal response capacity increasingly important\nThe objective of halting public debt accumulation supports short-term economic stability and better enables the Government to respond to shocks further ahead. For this reason, it is clear that although the numerical fiscal rules provided for in the Act on Public Finances will not take effect again until 2026, the fundamental principles underlying the Act \u2013 sustainability, prudence, and stability \u2013 require that the fiscal strategy take account of the business cycle position and rebuild the capacity of public finances to respond to economic shocks. \nPublic sector outcome improves year by year\nIn order to achieve the objective of halting the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio, the public sector net lending balance will improve each year until the goal is reached. The estimated public sector outcome will improve from a deficit of ISK 200bn, or just under 6% of GDP in 2022, to a deficit of no more than ISK 50bn, or just over 1% of GDP by the end of the period. This represents an improvement of 5 percentage points of GDP over the next five years.\n\u00a0\nAccording to the updated outlook, public debt as measured by the debt rule in the Act on Public Finances will total 40% in 2021 and an estimated 41% of GDP by the end of 2022. Based on the assumptions underlying macroeconomic forecasts of GDP and interest rates in coming years, together with given assumptions on the sale of State assets, public debt is projected at about 46% of GDP by the end of the period. Furthermore, the primary balance \u2013 i.e., the overall outcome net of the interest balance \u2013 will be positive in the final years of the strategy.\nIt should be noted that the objectives presented here are based on projected developments in underlying performance and debt but also allow for given deviations until the target in the final year of the strategy.\n\u00a0\nTotal public revenues are projected to average 38.5% of GDP in 2021 and 2022. Revenues are expected to rise by nearly 2 percentage points as a share of GDP, to 40.5% of GDP by the end of the period.\nPublic expenditures are projected to equal 48.5% of GDP in 2021 and fall to 44.5% of GDP in 2022, in tandem with strong GDP growth, a turnaround in the labour market and the associated reduction in unemployment-related expenditures, and the expiry of most of the temporary measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of the period, expenditures are projected at 41.5% of GDP, which is consistent with the average from 2018 and 2019. Expenditures as a share of GDP will therefore decline relative to the current position. This entails that spending growth must be contained so that expenditures do not rise faster than GDP. Real growth in Treasury expenditure must therefore be modest over the period, or less than 1% per year.\nThe outlook for local governments\u2019 outcome as a share of GDP is broadly unchanged from the approved fiscal plan. Local government debt will increase relative to the fiscal plan currently in effect, partly because the outcome for 2020 was weaker than previously projected. As a share of GDP, local government debt will increase somewhat over the horizon of the fiscal plan.\nSlack in output to close in 2022\nGDP will return to its pre-pandemic level as soon as 2022, according to the Statistics Iceland forecast on which the fiscal policy statement is based. Despite relatively strong GDP growth in 2021-2023, it is assumed that annual GDP will be 3-4% lower than was expected before the pandemic. Because of the erosion of potential output and the rapid turnaround, official forecasts assume that output will be close to potential from 2022 onwards.\nEconomic policy is affected strongly by the expectation that the slack in output will close in 2022. Although estimates of potential output are subject to considerable uncertainty, it is clear that the economy has rebounded strongly and that most indicators suggest increased resource utilisation. If the recovery proves as solid as forecasts indicate, the fundamental principles of prudence and stability underlying the Act on Public Finances require that the fiscal stance be tightened, both to prevent short-term overheating and to rebuild the public sector\u2019s strength in the long run. This is consistent with economic policy for the years to come, where the public sector will focus on adapting to changed circumstances after having intervened decisively in 2020-2021 in order to mitigate the impact of the economic contraction on households and businesses.\nDeclining productivity growth and an aging population\nAs the impact of short-term factors tapers off in the latter half of the fiscal strategy horizon, the assessment of economic developments will increasingly entail extrapolation based on underlying drivers, chief among them the aging of the population and changes in productivity.\nOwing to slow natural population growth combined with weaker productivity growth, the outlook is for the economy\u2019s growth potential to decline, all else being equal. \nIn line with developments in the above-mentioned drivers of potential output, Statistics Iceland has revised its estimate of the economy\u2019s annual growth potential downwards from 2.7% to 2.3%. This is consistent both with estimates from the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and with developments in the global economy. This is highly significant for the long-term outlook, as annual GDP will therefore be ISK 300bn less (at the 2021 price level) in 25 years\u2019 time than it would have been otherwise.\nUnless changes are made to the tax system, weaker output growth will reduce tax revenues and will therefore reduce the amount of spending the public sector can undertake in the long run. At the same time, weaker productivity growth and, in particular, an aging population call for increased spending.\nFiscal policy has a role to play in counteracting this trend and promoting increased long-term potential output throughout the economy. This can be seen in two ways in the fiscal strategy. \nFirst, increased investment supports potential output, and second, the fiscal policy fosters economic stability by tightening the fiscal stance as the economic recovery gains ground. \nCalculations due to uncertainty buffers developed further\nThe objectives of the fiscal strategy are based on the economic outlook as portrayed in Statistics Iceland\u2019s most recent macroeconomic forecast. It is probable that at some point during the horizon of the strategy, economic developments will be less favourable than is now considered likely. Economic forecasts cannot predict unforeseeable external events that have a decisive impact on economic developments. The fiscal strategy must provide the latitude to promote economic stability under conditions where the economic outlook deviates from what is now considered most likely. \nFor the first time, the fiscal strategy for 2018-2022 introduced an uncertainty buffer into the assumptions concerning the outcome targets to be included in annual fiscal plans. The uncertainty buffer was based on the sensitivity of performance and debt to the business cycle and the size of deviations in ISK terms, but in other respects it was not based on direct calculations.\nNow, however, calculations relating to uncertainty buffers have been developed further. In the new version, this entails determining the statistical probability that deviations from economic assumptions over the horizon of the strategy will lie within the historical bounds of the past 50 years. Because uncertainty increases over time, the statistical confidence interval grows accordingly wider. The uncertainty buffer should therefore be able to accommodate most setbacks and shocks to the public sector outcome. Only downturns of the magnitude of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-induced economic shock would fall outside the confidence interval as it is presented in the strategy. With this presentation of the confidence interval, plus the key feature of the strategy \u2013 i.e., the assumption that stronger GDP growth and derived revenues over and above targets will be used to improve the outcome \u2013 the fiscal strategy now incorporates greater flexibility vis-\u00e0-vis the business cycle than it did originally.\nFiscal rules and the Fiscal Council\nIn order to create the flexibility to apply fiscal policy to combat the economic repercussions of the pandemic, the numerical fiscal rules concerning performance and debt as provided for in the Act on Public Finances were set aside with special legislation passed in December 2020. This provided temporary scope for deficit operations and debt accumulation under these challenging circumstances, and it is in line with governmental responses all over the world. The fundamental principles of the Act on Public Finances \u2013 sustainability, prudence, stability, predictability, and transparency \u2013 are still fully in effect, and they serve as guideposts for Government policy formation. The numerical targets provided for in the Act will take effect again in 2026, and fiscal policy must ensure that this can happen successfully. According to provisions in the Act, the Fiscal Council is entrusted with assessing whether the Government\u2019s declared fiscal objectives and their enforcement will make this possible. The Council has two weeks after the presentation of the fiscal strategy to complete its comments on the strategy and deliver them to Parliament.", "id": "ab0f82ee0753338db2b9d5d60a81ba4d"}

The Ministry and leading members of the film industry joined forces in developing the policy, working in close collaboration. \n\nThe art and business of filmmaking in Iceland has tripled in size since 2010, such that the industry currently has achieved a significant cultural and economic footprint. The new film policy aligns with the government's overall plan to diversify the Icelandic economy, by boosting industries based on innovation, creativity and sustainability.\n\n\"Icelandic filmmaking is now at the highest level. As an art form, it is very accessible and so important for our language and national identity. It reflects contemporary life in Iceland and reveals key parts of our cultural heritage and history. As an industry, filmmaking is both international and sustainable. It creates value for the treasury, generates thousands of jobs, attracts foreign investment and has gained great respect abroad. It is my pleasure and duty to support the industry by any means available,\" says Lilja Alfre\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir, the Icelandic Minister of Education, Science and Culture.\n\nThe new film policy defines four key objectives: First, to create a thriving film culture that strengthens the nation's identity and the Icelandic language. Second, to provide a diverse and ambitious film education at all levels. Third, to enhance Iceland's international competitiveness. And fourth, to promote Iceland as a global brand in filmmaking. \n\nTen action points have been specified to support these objectives:\n\n1.\tStrengthen the support scheme to enable a more diverse range of films, in part by increasing the amount of the Icelandic Film Fund and establishing a new investment fund to boost TV production.\n2.\tExpand the overall role and efficiency of the Icelandic Film Center and the Film Council to stimulate a vibrant overall film culture in Iceland and ensure both domestic and international success for the film industry, and to build a public-private partnership between government and industry in realizing these policy objectives.\n3.\tImprove public awareness and access to Icelandic film heritage and to film productions in general by strengthening the Icelandic film database and laying foundations for a national streaming service.\n4.\tIncrease support of independently organized projects and initiatives such as art-house cinemas and international film festivals and events.\n5.\tAdd courses in filmmaking at all levels of education, with special emphases on providing film and media literacy to all children and teenagers and introducing, for the first time, a university-level degree in filmmaking.\n6.\tSecure the competitive position of Icelandic filmmaking through the ongoing development of a strong reimbursement scheme and tax incentives.\n7.\tSupport the film industry\u2019s initiative in building film clusters to foster international competitiveness and growth through collaboration within the industry and between it and related industries.\n8.\tImprove industry-related statistics and economic indicators via a new online platform in order to provide insights and overview and strengthen policymaking.\n9.\tImprove the working standards and environment for filmmakers by making work more family-friendly and establishing an artist wage fund for screenwriters and directors.\n10.\tPromote Icelandic filmmaking internationally as both sustainable and a year-round activity, and increase support for films and filmmakers traveling to prestigious festivals and events abroad.\n\nFind more information on mrn.is/kvikmyndastefna.", "id": "ab2d6b8f53e033988112140a5acdcc19"}

They noted that Iceland's participation in the EEA (European Economic Area) has been highly beneficial for Icelandic citizens as well as for the EU. Iceland and the other EEA partners have successfully been applying EU energy rules, adapted to the EEA specific situation, for more than a decade. Indeed, these rules have brought more choice for customers and helped energy markets become more efficient.\u00a0\n\nConcerning the incorporation of the third energy package in Iceland, the situation in Iceland is markedly different from countries with a cross-border energy network. Therefore, the special regime for Iceland that was agreed within the EEA Joint Commission, which avoids all unnecessary burdens, is the best fit for Iceland's circumstances.\u00a0\n\nThe Icelandic electricity system is currently an isolated system and is not connected with an interconnector between Iceland and the EU\u2019s internal energy market. In this regard, large parts of the provisions of the Third Energy Package, namely those that concern cross-border exchanges and infrastructure in electricity, do not apply or have no practical relevance to Iceland in the absence of any interconnection. As a result, the provisions on ACER (Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators) and the Regulation on cross-border electricity exchanges* will not have any tangible impact on Iceland's sovereign decision-making on energy matters.\n\nWere cross-border infrastructure to be put in place in the future, the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) would be responsible to decide on cross-border issues concerning Iceland, and not ACER. This has been agreed in the relevant adaptation text of the EEA Joint Committee Decision No 93/2017, from 5 May 2017 which reflects the autonomy of the EFTA institutions under the \"two pillar system\" of the EEA Agreement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe applicable provisions of the EU third energy package in no way affect the Government of Iceland\u2019s full sovereign control over Iceland\u2019s energy resources and the authority on how they shall be utilized and managed. Decisions on electricity interconnectors between Iceland and the EU\u2019s internal electricity market lie entirely within the competence of Icelandic authorities.

This position has been reiterated in a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the US Government.The submarines that are permitted to make service call do not carry nuclear weapons according to US policy and are not equipped to do so.\nIn recent years, the Icelandic and US governments have increased cooperation to strengthen situational awareness and readiness in the North Atlantic.

Those have yielded 48 positive results (0.86%) indicating that the prevelance of the virus is modest among the general population.\nA total of 473 cases have been identified in Iceland since the first case on February 28th. One person with COVID-19 has died. Twelve individuals with COVID-19 are hospitalized.\u00a0\n\nIceland health authorities and deCode Genetics have undertaken comprehensive screening for the virus that causes COVID-19 among the Icelandic population. The testing by deCode Genetics started Friday 13 March and the results of the first 5 571 diagnosed tests have yielded 48 positive samples.\n\nTo date a total of 4 197 samples have been diagnosed by the healthcare system. The healthcare system's testing has yielded 425 results indicating infection. About a third (34%) of all cases can be traced to overseas travel, mostly to high-risk areas identified in the European Alps. More than a quarter (32.7%) of cases have been traced to domestic transmission. The rest (33.2%) have not been conclusively traced to a source of transmission.\n\nCurrent efforts to estimate the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the general, largely non-symptomatic, non-quarantined, population in conjunctions with very expansive testing already performed on those who were symptomatic or were for other reasons considered to be at-risk for having contracted the virus, have resulted in a total of 9 768 individuals in Iceland being tested out of a population of 364 thousand. In terms of tests per one million inhabitants, Iceland has now tested 26 762, which is the highest proportion we are aware of in the world.\n\nThis leads to a higher confidence in our efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 disease in the country. The combined efforts also provide a very valuable insight into the spread of the virus. In the coming days more results from testing in the general population will continue to elicit a much clearer picture of the actual spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Iceland.\n\nThe results of the additional tests performed by deCode have given an indication that efforts to limit the spread of the virus have been effective so far. In Iceland, these measures have focused on testing, contact tracing of infections, social distancing, public efforts to increase basic awareness of hand sanitation, voluntary self-quarantine measures (currently about 5 448 individuals), and strict measures at healthcare institutions, nursing homes and the likes. Of the 473 cases identified 13 are individuals over age 70, considered to be the most at-risk group.\n\nA ban on gatherings of 100 people or more took effect on March 15 and are planned to remain for four weeks. Secondary and tertiary education institutions have closed, but primary schools and kindergartens will remain open with specific measures implemented to limit infection risks. Icelanders abroad have been advised to return home early, and Iceland has decided to join the EU/Schengen ban on non-essential travel from outside the area.\n\nIt will remain the focus of Icelandic authorities to slow down the spread of the virus in order to protect the infrastructure of the healthcare system. Iceland will also focus on using its geographic location and high testing capabilities to provide information and data to the global scientific community in order to contribute to a better understanding and help limit the damage being done by the pandemic.\n\nThorolfur Gudnason, Chief Epidemiologist, says that the data being collected provides valuable information. \"There are strong indications that our efforts to contain the spread of the virus have been effective. About half of the diagnosed cases are from individuals who had been quarantined. Our focus is to protect those must vulnerable from contracting the virus, while trying to ensure that the overall spread of the virus remains slow. We are optimistic that the combined efforts to test a large part of the population will provide insights that can contribute to the world's response to this pandemic.\"\n\n\"It is amazing to see how the community is coming together as one to deal with this threat. Here at deCode people are working 24/7 to screen for and to sequence the virus. The screening tells us where the virus is and the sequencing how it differs between the places where it is and how it continues to mutate\u201d, said K\u00e1ri Stef\u00e1nsson, CEO of deCode.\nSvand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir, Minister of Health says that the Icelandic government's focus remains on minimising the effect of the pandemic. \"Our number one priority is to limit the damage of the pandemic to the health of our citizens and to our social and economic infrastructure.

The accounts show a surplus of ISK 84bn, as compared with a surplus of ISK 39bn in 2017. The results show clearly Iceland\u2019s strong fiscal position. Revenues totalled ISK 828bn and operating expenditures ISK 780bn. Net financial expense was negative in the amount of ISK 56bn, and the share in earnings of Government-owned companies was positive by ISK 91bn.\n\u201cThe economy is at a turning point after an exceptionally long and strong economic boom with sizeable revenue gains for households, businesses, and the Treasury. The positive Treasury outcome for 2018 reflects the strength of the economy despite the slowdown in the latter half of the year. The past several years have been characterised by some expenditure increases in line with revenue growth and, not least, the Treasury\u2019s declining interest burden. With deleveraging and refinancing on more favourable terms, fiscal resilience has been shored up substantially, which will stand us in good stead as GDP growth eases,\u201d said Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Bjarni Benediktsson about the outcome of the Government accounts.\nThe Government accounts for 2018 are the second to be published in accordance with provisions in the Act on Public Sector Finances. A three-year plan for the implementation of new financial reporting standards is underway and should be complete by the time the 2019 Government accounts are ready.\nTreasury performance ISK 5bn better than was assumed in the fiscal budget\nWhen the outcome of the Government accounts is compared with the overall goals in the fiscal plan and the fiscal budget this is done according to the Government finance statistics (GFS) standards. Based on that standard the overall Treasury performance in 2018 was positive by ISK 38bn, or ISK 5bn better than was assumed in the fiscal budget, highlighting both the strength of the economy during the year and successful adherence to the budget. \nThe balance sheet changed significantly at the beginning of 2017, when tangible operational assets were capitalised, among other things, with the result that the balance sheet now gives a reliable overall view of Treasury assets, liabilities, and equity. Total assets as of end-2018 were ISK 2,224bn, while liabilities totalled ISK 1,611bn. Equity totalled ISK 613bn, an increase of ISK 117bn.\n\u201cIt is now clear that economic growth will be weaker in coming years than it has been, owing in particular to the contraction in tourism. In view of this, spending growth will be scaled back, but in addition, the operating surplus will shrink in line with reduced economic growth. The main tasks for the next few years will be to improve public funds and to enhance efficiency and productivity in the Government. In this way, we will stand guard over important development of infrastructure and public services while strengthening fiscal resilience even further,\u201d said the Minister.", "id": "b6a860b48f503328a41697b3de9ddd52"}

It numbers ten central volcanoes, eight of which are subglacial. Two of these are among the most active in Iceland. Volcanic areas are home to endemic groundwater fauna that has survived the Ice Age. The area is unique due to the forces of the nature that shaped it, an interplay of fire and ice and the resulting geological diversity.\nThe Icelandic Government\u2019s proposal for the inscription of Vatnaj\u00f6kull National Park on the World Heritage List was presented to the office of the World Heritage Convention in Paris in January 2018. Since then, the proposal has been under review by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which assists the Committee in evaluating the value, authenticity, integrity and the status of protection of the natural sites that are nominated to the list.

Of special importance is the affirmation of the 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement, and the determination to keep that goal alive by reviewing the so-called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in 2022. \nOne of the main tasks of COP26 (the 26th annual conference of the Parties to \u00a0the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)) was to receive and review updated NDCs from Parties to the Paris Agreement. The NDCs that countries submitted in Paris in 2015 would have resulted in global warming of over 3\u00b0C, which is incompatible with the goal of the Paris Agreement of keeping warming well within 2\u00b0C while pursuing efforts to keep warming within 1.5\u00b0C. Many countries, including Iceland, updated their NDCs before COP26 and upgraded their ambition level. Still, the current NDCs are likely to result in 2.4\u00b0C warming, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).\nIceland upgraded its ambition level from 40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to 2030 compared to 1990, to 55% cuts. Iceland has, along with Norway, an agreement with the European Union and its Member States of collective delivery of the Paris Agreement, so that the 29 countries will jointly achieve 55% reduction in emissions by 2030.\nIceland submits its first Long-Term-Low-Emissions Strategy\nIceland submitted its first Long-Term Low-Emissions Strategy to the UNFCCC just before COP26, and is one of almost 40 countries that have done so. The Strategy outlines possible pathways to reach Iceland\u2018s stated goal of achieving climate neutrality no later than 2040. Earlier this year the Icelandic Parliament adopted a legislation affirming that goal, making Iceland one of a dozen countries or so to make a goal of climate neutrality legally binding.\nIceland\u2018s Prime Minister, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, addressed COP26\u00a0at its outset, emphasizing the need for countries to upgrade their pledges to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nThe main results of COP26 in Glasgow are: \n\nReaching a consensus among the 197 Member States of the UNFCCC on a main outcome, which gives rise for optimism.\nAn historic affirmation of the importance of keeping the 1.5\u00b0C goal alive.\nA call for more ambitious NDCs, compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement, to be submitted before the end of 2022. \nThe UNFCCC Secretariat was given the task of updating an annual report on NDCs and the expected resulting cuts in emissions. The report will be submitted to COP.\nThe pledge of 100 billion dollar in climate finance to developing countries will be met soon, with a regret shown that the goal was not reached by 2020.\nThe so-called \u201eRulebook\u201c of the Paris Agreement was finalized, which makes the Agreement fully operationalized.\nFor the first time a COP Decision calls for a reduction in the use of coal and in subsidies for fossil fuels.\nDeveloped countries will double their assistance to developing countries for adaptation to climate change.\n\nThe core decision of COP26 emphasizes the impact of climate change on the oceans and the cryosphere, and on biological diversity; and the importance of nature-based solutions, including the restoration of ecosystems.\nAn emphasis is put on just transition, equality and human rights in the changes ahead, and on the enhanced role of young people in climate projects and decisions.\nIceland sets ambitious goals on land use and zero emissions vehicles\nIceland signed five declarations on climate mitigation efforts in selected fields during COP26, that were connected with the Glasgow meeting, but not a part of the formal COP26 decisions and proceedings. They involve methane emissions, forests and land use, zero-emissions vehicles, emissions from shipping and international public support for the clean energy transition.\nIceland has set ambitious goals and projects regarding two of the above declarations; on land use and zero emissions vehicles.\u00a0In it\u2019s Climate Action Plan Iceland put an emphasis on clean energy transition in transport and on nature-based solutions in land use, including afforestation, revegetation and restoration of drained wetlands. Iceland has greatly enhanced its efforts in land-use climate mitigation actions in recent years, with significant increase in government-funded projects.

The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a sharp deterioration in Iceland\u2019s near-term growth and public finance outlook. The rating is constrained by the small size of the economy and limited export diversification. The negative outlook reflects rising government debt/GDP and downside risks of a prolonged and intensified pandemic leading to macroeconomic and financial spill-overs.\nParliamentary elections in 2021 could lead to a fiscal strategy with a slower debt reduction path, but Fitch believes that broad political support for rebuilding fiscal buffers and a strong track record of public debt reduction supports fiscal policy credibility over the long run.\nIceland has high flexibility to finance large fiscal deficits arising from its response to the pandemic shock over the next few years. Icelandic private pension funds managed 168% of GDP in assets, with roughly 70% invested domestically at end-2019. The government also has strong access to the international bond market, a large cash deposit buffer and is supported by robust liquidity in the banking system.\nSwift, decisive public health measures have hitherto averted the need for a strict national lockdown to manage the spread of the virus, while substantial fiscal and monetary policy stimulus packages have limited the decline in consumption and maintained broad macroeconomic and financial stability through the crisis.\nThe main factors that could lead to a positive rating action are greater confidence in general government debt/GDP stabilising in the medium term and greater confidence that the economy will avoid a prolonged crisis. \nThe main factors that could lead to a negative rating action are materially higher than forecast general government debt/GDP, for example due to lack of fiscal consolidation after the initial COVID-19 related support measures, weaker growth prospects or materialisation of contingent liabilities; capital outflows at a scale that precipitates macroeconomic instability or erosion of external buffers; and severe and prolonged economic weakness. \n\nFitch Ratings Press Release", "id": "c447222209013417b983246a7628bdbb"}

According to the fiscal budget proposal for 2021, introduced before Parliament today alongside the fiscal plan for 2021-2025, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Treasury is estimated to be negative in the amount of ISK 192bn next year. Taxes will be a total of ISK 52bn lower in 2021 than they would have been without the decisions taken by the Government during the current electoral term.\nFiscal policy used systematically to combat the recession\nThe fiscal budget proposal continues the policy laid down this year with the Government\u2019s emergency measures, which focus on broad and strong measures to support the economy, save jobs, protect households, and lay the foundation for value creation after the pandemic-induced crisis subsides. The Treasury\u2019s strong position at the onset of the pandemic has enabled the authorities to respond decisively to its repercussions by supporting distressed households and businesses. The fiscal budget proposal reflects the Government\u2019s intention to overcome difficult circumstances and use fiscal policy as a powerful tool in that effort. No further cutbacks will be required of Government functions, and all key transfer systems will be protected. In order to guard against increased expenditures, new spending increases are restricted to pandemic response measures.\nThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Treasury is negative in the amount of ISK 192bn in 2021. The factor weighing heaviest is the ISK 89bn contraction in tax revenues caused by reduced activity in society. Treasury revenues are also reduced because of measures undertaken in response to the pandemic, including reimbursement of value-added tax on labour, expedited reduction of the bank tax, and cancellation of the bed-night tax, which cost the Treasury about ISK 17bn combined. In addition, unemployment benefits are expected to increase by ISK 23bn.

In 2021, allocations to healthcare will increase by a further ISK 15bn, excluding wage and price movements, with the construction of the new Landsp\u00edtali hospital weighing heaviest, with an increase at nearly ISK 7bn.\nAllocations to social, housing, and insurance weigh heaviest on the expenditures side of the budget, at 26% of total allocations. Key priorities for this electoral term include increasing the tax-free threshold for elderly persons\u2019 earned income, lengthening childbirth leave, increasing initial contributions towards construction of rental housing for low-income people, and implementing legislation on participating loans. The Act on Participating Loans, which enters into force on 1 November 2020, will help individuals with limited income and assets to acquire their first apartment.\nAllocations to education and culture are expected to increase by nearly ISK 6bn in 2021. Of that total, ISK 2bn are earmarked for the expected increase in student numbers because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the criteria in the newly passed Act on the Icelandic Student Loan Fund are taken into account. An additional ISK 1bn will be allocated to university-level education in accordance with the objective of bringing Iceland\u2019s university funding in line with the OECD average. Furthermore, the educational system has been strengthened at the upper secondary and university levels, and work is well underway on an ambitious language technology plan that will make it possible to use the Icelandic language in all equipment and in software from global IT leaders.\nEstimated allocations to innovation total ISK 25bn, an increase of just over ISK 5bn relative to the estimate for 2020.\nStrong emphasis has been placed on research and innovation, including with the establishment of Kr\u00eda, an investment fund intended to promote development, growth, and competitiveness in the domestic economy. Moreover, concessions for companies\u2019 research and development (R&D) activities will be more than trebled relative to 2017, to over ISK 7bn in the 2021 fiscal budget proposal. \nAllocations to IT projects will be increased substantially, or by ISK 2.3bn. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, the Digital Iceland bureau has made a major push towards the digitisation of public services in cooperation with Government institutions.\nEnvironmental affairs have been highly important for the entire electoral term. This includes the action plan for climate, soil conservation, and reclamation. Furthermore, increased allocations have been made towards broad infrastructure development at tourism sites, alongside increased patrolling. A total of nearly ISK 24bn are earmarked for environmental affairs in the coming year, an increase of ISK 3.4bn relative to 2020. The largest single item is an increase in allocations to the Avalanche Fund for the strengthening of avalanche defence structures.\nA lighter tax burden\nNext year, taxation will be some ISK 34bn lower in 2021 than it would have been without the Government\u2019s tax cuts from 2017. Furthermore, the special pandemic response measures reduce Treasury revenues by more than ISK 17bn in 2021; therefore, taxes in 2021 will be a total of approx. ISK 52bn lower than they would have been without the changes implemented since 2017.\nTax changes in recent years have entailed reforming the tax system with an eye to increasing disposable income for the lowest income groups, boosting the competitiveness of the domestic economy, and working towards achieving the Government\u2019s environmental goals. The most broad-based measures are changes in personal income taxes, which will be fully implemented in 2021, with a three-bracket tax system and a lower tax burden for the lowest-paid groups in society. In all, disposable income for the lowest-income persons will rise by just over ISK 120,000 per person per year, increasing aggregate disposable income by ISK 21 bn per year.This does not include the special increase in the personal deduction in 2018, in the amount of nearly ISK 2bn, which has also been of benefit to households.\nThe payroll tax has also been lowered considerably during the term, and firms\u2019 tax burden will be ISK 8bn lower in 2021 than it would have otherwise. This does not include the temporary payroll tax reduction to address the impact of wage hikes according to the Living Standards Agreement. The total R&D expense reimbursed by the State has also been doubled.\nThe emphasis that the Government has placed on environmental protection and on limiting CO2 emissions is reflected in the revision of certain taxes. The carbon tax has been increased significantly during the term, and a tax has been imposed on emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Simultaneously, value-added tax has been waived on purchases of eco-friendly motor vehicles, bicycles, and home charging stations. \nThe fiscal budget proposal provides for an increase in the tax-free threshold for inheritance tax, which will lower levies by an estimated ISK 500m in 2021 and will benefit smaller estates the most. In addition, the review of the investment tax base is in its final stages. Finally, there are plans for new or increased tax subsidies to support organisations that work in the public interest, the so-called third sector, in the amount of ISK 2.1bn. \nInvestment initiative\nAllocations to investment are high in historical context, at ISK 111 bn. The largest single investment project is the construction of the new Landsp\u00edtali hospital, which is to receive allocations totalling nearly ISK 12bn in 2021.\nAllocations to various investments increase by just over ISK 36bn relative to the 2020 budget. The year-on-year increase is due in large part to mitigating measures undertaken by the Government, and to the Government\u2019s policy of supporting the economy until activity picks up again, including with a special initiative for investment in infrastructure, brainpower, and knowledge. The total scope of the investment and development initiative in 2021 is ISK 27.2bn.\nFiscal plan 2021-2025: Turning around deficit operations the key objective\nThe most important challenge facing the Government during the term of the fiscal plan for 2021-2025 will be reversing the public deficit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and bringing debt accumulation under control. Under circumstances like these, deficit operations do not represent economic losses. The funds are being used to strengthen households\u2019 and businesses\u2019 financial position and to prevent the permanent loss of jobs and value. The objective is to support and stimulate the economy so that when the pandemic-induced recession ends, Iceland will emerge as a competitive society whose prosperity is based on strong human capital and a vibrant economy. \nThe Government\u2019s first responses to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic entailed using the Treasury\u2019s strong position to protect households and businesses against the worst of the shock by implementing a variety of measures. The purpose of the measures was to support households\u2019 and businesses\u2019 liquidity and solvency to the extent possible, supporting them until the economic situation improved as it was hoped that the pandemic would be short-lived.\nHalting debt accumulation: an explicit objective\nThe combined deficit for 2020 and 2021 could come to as much as ISK 600bn. Public sector debt according to the debt rule in the Act on Public Finances could therefore rise from 28% of GDP at the end of 2019 to 48% of GDP by end-2021.\nThe Government considers it important to set clear and realistic targets for halting the rise in the public debt-to-GDP ratio no later than in the final year of the fiscal plan, thereby stopping the spiral of deficit operations and debt accumulation, with the aim of returning Iceland to fiscal strength. \nIn order to achieve this objective, measures must be taken to improve the fiscal performance by ISK 37,5bn per year in 2023-2025, an amount equivalent to just under 3% of public sector turnover or slightly more than 1% of GDP relative to the baseline fiscal scenario and the current macroeconomic forecast. Measures of this magnitude are essential to ensure continued fiscal sustainability, so that public sector finances will be conducive to economic stability and the Treasury will be able to provide a cushion against economic shocks in the future.\nWith these performance improvements, gross public debt will be more than ISK 230bn lower at the end of 2025 than if the measures had not been taken. It is assumed that debt accumulation will halt at about 59% of GDP instead of peaking at 65% of GDP. The debt ratio will then continue to decline on the basis of the potential output growth assumed in the fiscal plan.\n\nBill of legislation on extended deviation from fiscal rules introduced before Parliament\nThe report accompanying the fiscal plan for 2021-2025 states that, in order to prevent too harsh a fiscal response as early as 2023, it is necessary to deviate from numerical fiscal rules for longer than the three years provided for in the Act on Public Finances. Otherwise, it would be necessary to reduce a deficit of 6% of GDP to 2.5% virtually at a single stroke.\nTherefore, alongside the presentation of the fiscal plan, the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs is presenting a bill of legislation amending the Act on Public Finances. This entails that the requirements laid down in Article 7 of the Act on Public Finances, no. 123/2015, regarding the overall balance and the public debt ratio, referred to as numerical fiscal rules, will not apply in 2023-2025. \nLate presentation of fiscal plan \nAccording to the Act on Public Finances, the fiscal plan is to be presented no later than by 1 April each year. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Parliament passed a temporary amendment to the Act on Public Finances, authorising the presentation of a revised fiscal strategy, fiscal plan, and fiscal budget proposal no later than on the day Parliament convenes for the autumn legislative session. The revised fiscal strategy was introduced in August and passed on 3 September. The fiscal plan, which entails a more detailed presentation of the objectives in the fiscal strategy, is introduced today, alongside the fiscal budget proposal.", "id": "c852964c4b893f31b704a37e74c2214d"}

A large proportion of seafood from developing countries goes through a complicated route to reach markets and businesses in the value chain have no incentives to promote the origin of the product. Vietnam produces 7-8 million tons of seafood every year, making it the world\u2019s fourth largest producer of seafood. More than half of the production comes from farms, for example shrimp and pangasius. A large proportion of production is in the hands of relatively small businesses with limited access to European markets.\nThe preliminary study is an opportunity to examine the feasibility of establishing a simpler and more efficient value chain for seafood in Vietnam, in cooperation with producers of pangasius and shrimp. The goal is to enhance the profitability of producers and ensure better product quality for consumers. This way, the project works towards the Sustainable Development Goals of decent work and economic growth (no. 8), responsible consumption and production (no. 12) and life below water (no 14). Close cooperation between producers and vendors and technical solutions that meet consumer demand for transparency can lead to better efficiency and higher prices for producers. If the project is successful, a follow-up project will be initiated with more companies in Vietnam and possibly in neighbouring countries as well. Planned completion of the preliminary study is January 2023.\nMAR Advisors is a specialized seafood and infrastructure advisory firm and its partners in Vietnam will be Maranda ltd. and other smaller businesses operating on the banks of the Mekong river.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals Partnership Fund aims to support Icelandic companies who are interested in advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals through cooperative projects in developing countries.

{"date": "February 19, 2019", "title": "Tax burden on people in the lowest income group reduced", "content": "The tax burden on persons in the lowest income group would be reduced by 2 percentage points if the changes to the tax system which the government is proposing are adopted. These changes are in line with the government\u2019s policy declaration of February 2018. In particular, they would improve the position of women, people aged 18-24, people aged 25-34, persons with disabilities, senior citizens, and those who do not own their own homes or who receive housing supplements.\nA new lowest tax bracket would be added, with funds allocated for the lowering of taxes being transferred to middle and low-income groups according to plans for changes in the tax system that Bjarni Benediktsson, minister of finance and economic affairs, unveiled today. The proposals are seen as delivering about ISK 14.7 b in changes in the income tax system. Increases in child benefit in 2019 amount to ISK 1.6 b and the raising of personal tax credit by more than the rise in the consumer price index puts a further ISK 1.7 b into taxpayers\u2019 hands. Altogether, therefore, the government\u2019s proposals on tax cuts and increased child benefit payments come to ISK 18 b.\nIt has been the government\u2019s aim to lighten financial burdens and to make for greater equality, and it is in this spirit that a task-force has come up with these proposed changes. The task-force found that the most desirable way of working towards equality is to add a lower tax bracket rather than to change personal tax credit or the tax-free threshold. It therefore recommends the use of a new tax bracket which will specifically lighten the proportion of wages paid in tax by those who are in the lowest income decile.

Others include the lengthening of maternity/paternity leave from nine to twelve months in two stages: to 10 months as from the beginning of 2020 and to one year as from the beginning of 2021. On the housing front, the government will work on the implementation of the proposals submitted by a task-force, in consultation with the social partners (unions and SA) and the local authorities. These include measures on tenant protection, the allocation of state-owned land for residential housing, including rental apartments, and the expansion of the socially-assisted public rental dwellings system by means of foundation capital contributions and higher income ceilings. The task-force\u2019s proposals on measures to eradicate social dumping will also be implemented. Work is also in progress on the formulation of proposals to lower the threshold for young people and low-income groups to enter the real-estate market.\nMeasures of various types have already been taken over the past year which have a bearing on the economic position of ordinary working people. As an example of measures taken to strengthen the social rights of the individual, it may be pointed out that unemployment benefit payments have been raised from ISK 227,000 to ISK 270,000 per month and the maximum level of income-related benefits has been raised from ISK 358,000 to ISK 425,000; child benefit was raised by about 16% between 2018 and 2019 and the income level at which benefit reductions begin has been raised by 29%; the amount that senior citizens are permitted to earn through employment without paying tax has been raised from ISK 25,000 to ISK 100,000; the maximum payment from the Income Insurance Fund has been raised from ISK 385,000 to ISK 633,000 per month; the ceiling on monthly payments during maternity/paternity leave has gone up from ISK 500,000 to ISK 600,000; dental treatment costs borne by senior citizens and persons with disabilities have been cut and consultation fees at primary health clinics have been abolished for these groups.\nTax burden on people in the lowest income group reduced (in Polish)", "id": "cb3d2178df4b3d7f853e83a5be884b90"}

The changes introduced by the new regulations are summarised below.\nAs hitherto, more stringent restrictions apply in the metropolitan area than elsewhere in the country. Outside the metropolitan area, the main change now taking effect is that the \u2018social distance\u2019 to be maintained between persons who do not share the same home has been increased from 1 m to 2 m.\nRestrictions applying outside the metropolitan area \u2013 principal changes:\n\nThe social distance\u00a0between individuals is increased to 2 metres.\nThe use of face masks\u00a0is compulsory in places where the 2-m social distance cannot be guaranteed; these include shops.\nAt events:\u00a0A maximum of 20 persons may occupy each separate area, sitting in numbered seats allocated to them by name.\nSports that do not involve physical contact, in which it is possible to observe the 2-m social distance and a maximum of 20 participants in each separate area, are permitted, both indoors and out of doors. \nNotwithstanding the 2-metre social distance requirement,\u00a0physical contact is permitted between sportsmen at practices and in competitions held by the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland (\u00cdS\u00cd), but they are to observe the 2-m social distance rule in changing rooms and other parts of the premises when not taking part in competitions or practices. Notwithstanding the general maximum of 20 persons, up to 50 persons may gather at practices and competitions organised by the Association. \u00a0\nNo spectators are permitted at sporting events, either indoors or out of doors.\nSports and fitness activities:\u00a0Subject to certain conditions, sports and fitness activities may be organised and pursued providing that these are structured group sessions in which all participants are registered, the maximum size of each group being 20 persons.

There are demand pressures in the real estate market, with prices at historical highs and beginning to deviate from underlying fundamentals. Indicators imply, however, that the pace of price increases has begun to ease. The tourism industry is still growing considerably but at a slower pace. Credit growth has begun to pick up, corporate lending in particular. Although the external trade surplus has narrowed in the recent term, the external balance of the economy still appears conducive to stability in the next few years. Households' and businesses' position is still strong, with increased leverage and robust private consumption counterbalanced by high asset prices. The commercial banks' resilience is still significant in spite of sizeable dividend payments in the recent past. Large dividend payments alongside subordinated debt issuance will tend to reduce the banks' resilience. Dividend payments must be made with an eye to the banks' liquidity. \nSome of the country\u2019s financial infrastructure will be renewed in the near future which can amplify stress and contagion if risk is realized. It is important that supervisors pay close attention as the replacement progresses and be prepared to act should complications in the infrastructure, or related areas, arise.\nWith regard to payment institutions and other parties which undertake payment services, the council discussed an ongoing review on the supervision of certain risks related to payment service providers, i.e. chargeback and concentration risk. \nThe Financial Stability Council\u2019s next meeting will be held on 14 March 2018.", "id": "cf432724793338699e679538e1d30476"}

Iceland's economy is strong enough to respond to the outbreak, however the effect of the virus on the global economy is hard to predict and will shape the impact on the country. \nIn order to protect the Icelandic economy, the Government is implementing a systematic and wide-ranging response through the following measures: \n\nBusinesses experiencing temporary difficulties due to a fall in revenue will be given flexibility, e.g. extended deadlines for taxes and other public charges. \nEfforts will be made to provide temporary relief to the tourism industry, including temporarily reducing industry-specific tax payments. \n\u00a0Once the situation returns to normal, a marketing campaign will be launched to promote Iceland as a tourist destination and Icelanders will be encouraged to travel domestically. \n\u00a0Measures to stimulate private consumption and demand will be enacted, e.g. tax reduction or increased benefits. \nOngoing and planned infrastructure projects will be accelerated. \n\u00a0The Government will cooperate with the Icelandic Financial Services Association on their response to foreseeable liquidity and payment difficulties of tourism companies.\nThe HF-Fund (former HFF-Fund) will transfer funds from the Central Bank to increase the ability of banks and creditors to provide credit to both companies and individuals.\u00a0\n\nFiscal strategy plan delayed \nDue to the worsening economic outlook, the economic assumptions of the current fiscal policy statement will not hold and will need to be substantially revised. The Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs will request the Parliament to consider a revised fiscal statement in conjunction with a deferred fiscal strategy plan. The plan should remain unchanged before April 1, but the plan is to submit it by mid-May, provided the necessary criteria have been clarified. \nIn conjunction with the revision of the fiscal policy statement, a special investment effort is under way which will significantly increase the Treasury's investment level in the coming years. The plan will be financed by selling \u00cdslandsbanki, a government-owned bank, in part or in full if conditions are favourable.

These include competition in the telecom and IT market, investment in these markets, and emphasis on innovation. Furthermore, a strong economy and high rates of literacy and general education enable the general public to use IT and telecom services more effectively for their own benefit.\nIceland\u2019s outstanding results are thanks to the development that has taken place in recent years, with an eye to ensuring well-being and high standards of living nationwide, together with diversified employment opportunities. The competitiveness of individual regions is determined in part by access to secure high-speed internet connections.\nThe Icelandic authorities lay down their policies in their telecommunications strategy, which states that Iceland shall promote accessible, user-friendly, economical, efficient, secure, and environment-friendly electronic communications. Furthermore, the Telecommunications Fund has the role of promoting telecom development outside marketing areas on the basis of the telecommunications strategy.\nIceland\u2019s Electronic Communications Act\u00a0is based for the most part on the relevant European Union legislation, in keeping with Iceland\u2019s obligations under the EEA Agreement.

For marketing reasons, they have prioritized fibre optic cable installation in greater Reykjav\u00edk area and the Eyjafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur area. State and local government participation is vital in order to bring fibre networks to rural areas, a project that is well underway.\nThe Iceland\u2019s Rural Fibre Project (Icel. \u00cdsland lj\u00f3stengt)\u00a0is a short-term Government initiative to bring 100 Mb/s wired internet to 99.9% of households and businesses nationwide by year-end 2020. The State contributes funding for the project, and local governments can apply for subsidies that depend on their own contributions and other criteria, so as to begin fibre network installation in sparsely populated areas. It is assumed that telecom companies will eventually install fibre networks in all population centres in Iceland.\nIceland\u2019s Rural Fibre\u00a0Project was launched in 2016 and is overseen by the Telecommunications Fund. Roughly 5,500 households and businesses were included in the project at the outset, and local governments have yet only to negotiate connection agreements in 2019 and 2020 for the last 1,500 buildings in sparsely populated areas to reach that target.\nStrong emphasis is placed on economy, synergies with other utilities development projects, and cooperation with telecom providers insofar as is possible.

At the event, policy makers and public and private sector representatives gathered to reflect on and explore recent solutions and policy tools to further efforts to achieve equal pay for work of equal value.

All children's activities are back to normal, gatherings of up to 50 people are now allowed, businesses that require close proximity with customers can be resumed and several other restrictions have been lifted. However, strong emphasis continues to be placed on maintaining 2 meters separation between individuals, where possible, and the importance of personal hygiene, hand washing and other individualized habits that reduce transmission risk have been highlighted.\n\"We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fast deceleration of the pandemic in Iceland. However, it is extremely important to remain vigilant and minimize the risk of a renewed outbreak. If we see any signs of a re-emerging of the virus, we will be prepared to implement appropriate measures to extinguish any localized infection clusters,\u201c says Thorolfur Gudnason, chief epidemiologist.\nOf the 1 799 individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19 in Iceland, 1 750 are no longer infected. Sadly, 10 people have lost their lives to the disease. The peak in the number of active cases occurred on 5 April (1 096 cases), but currently there are 39 known infections and 3 individuals are hospitalized, none in intensive care.\nSocial distancing measures\nThe initial measures in Iceland, imposed 16 March, banned gatherings of 100 or more people. These restrictions were toughened on 22 March when the limit on gatherings was set at 20 individuals. The second phase of the social distancing measures also called for the closures of gyms, public swimming pools, pubs as well as operations that due to their nature require close proximity between people, such as beauty salons, hairdressers, barbers, massage parlours and the like. Many of these restrictions have been lifted, although gyms and public pools remain closed, with the pools set to re-open 18 May if there is no backlash. \nPrimary schools and day-care centres have been open throughout the period. Many coffee shops and restaurants have also remained open. No lockdowns have been imposed on the Icelandic population. Stricter measures were temporarily imposed in a few areas where there was reason to fear that contagion would become rampant if left unchecked.\nTesting, tracing and quarantining\nA total of 51 663 tests have been performed, which is 141 931 on a per million inhabitants basis. About two-thirds of the tests have been performed by deCode Genetics on generally asymptomatic individuals. About a third have been performed by the National University Hospital in Reykjavik on people who have shown symptoms that are similar to COVID-19. The testing level is higher than in any other country, except the Faroe Islands.\nEvery one of the 1 799 cases in Iceland have been successfully identified as being either an imported case or a local transmission. 342 of the cases were imported (98,8% of those were Icelanders who returned home with an infection). The rest were spread locally.\nSince the outset of the pandemic Iceland has followed a policy of quarantining individuals who have been in contact with infected individuals, or were for other reasons believed to have been at risk of being infected. A total of 19 380 individuals (more than 5% of the population) has completed a quarantine period of up to 14 days. Currently 743 people are quarantined in their homes.\n57% of those who have tested positive for COVID-19 were already isolated in quarantine when they were diagnosed, which is believed to underline the effectiveness of those measures in combating the spread of the virus.\nProtection of the elderly population and remote care\nSevere restrictions on visitations to nursing homes and hospitals were implemented very early in the pandemic. Older and more vulnerable groups outside such institutions have also shown extreme care in avoiding situations conducive to contagion. The results so far have been that no serious outbreaks in large homes for the elderly have occurred in Iceland and a low proportion of the population aged 70+ has contracted the virus. 86 individuals over the age of 70 have been diagnosed with COVID-19. 66 of those (77%) are no longer infected, 7 have died.\nThe National University Hospital organized a highly effective system of remote care and monitoring of patients very early on. This has had the effect of reducing the number of hospitalizations, and the constant dialogue between hospital staff and ill patients in their homes, resulted in more timely interventions and reduced the demand for intensive care treatments and oxygen support.\nDistancing likely to remain a social norm\nThe Icelandic health authorities have stated that personal measures will remain the best long-term protection for the population. This includes basic hygiene, such as frequent hand washing. A rule that allows for a distance of 2 meters between people, whenever possible, will also remain in effect in one form or another for some time. The Icelandic authorities have not recommended that the public wears any sorts of face masks or cloths, and such practices are extremely rare in Iceland.\nIceland's position is unusual\nIt needs to be emphasized that the situation in Iceland is unusual in many ways. The population is small, cohesive and mostly homogenous. \"We are an island with one major point of entry from abroad. Many other peculiarities make Iceland\u2019s position different from most other nations. That being said, we have a very sincere hope that our efforts, both in terms of policy and data generation will prove to be valuable for academics and policy makers in the future. The world is all in this together and it is vital that every country draws learnings both internally and externally to improve our readiness for any similar events in the future, or the continuation of this event in the upcoming months and years,\" says Thorolfur Gudnason, Chief Epidemiologist.\nFurther press enquiries should be directed to Mar\u00eda Mj\u00f6ll J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

{"date": "March 22, 2021", "title": "Fiscal plan 2022-2026: The right measures delivered progress and a positive outlook", "content": "The Government\u2019s measures in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic have been highly successful, and the medium-term outlook is more favourable than was assumed last year. Households\u2019 disposable income increased in 2020, and the contraction turned out considerably less than previously estimated. These are the main elements of the fiscal plan for 2022-2026, introduced today.\nThe actions taken by the Government in the past year have mitigated the economic crisis, with well over 3,000 companies and tens of thousands of individuals benefiting from a variety of support measures amounting to tens of billions of kr\u00f3nur.\nIn the next few years, the economy is expected to rebound strongly, and the Government\u2019s principle objectives in the fiscal plan are to support economic growth and halt debt accumulation.\nResponses to the pandemic\nThe Government\u2019s objective is for Iceland to emerge from the current economic situation an even stronger and more competitive society where prosperity is based on a robust economy and the vigour of its people. The main focus of pandemic response measures is three-fold:\n\u00a0\n\nFiscal policy in the service of resilience. Fiscal policy applied systematically to ensure stability and create economic resilience. Emphasis placed on safeguarding the progress made in social welfare and healthcare.\nValuable jobs, investment, and increased prosperity. A strong foothold for an economy driven by valuable jobs and investments. Emphasis on education, research, innovation, infrastructure, and environmental and climate issues. Targeted reforms to the economic and employment framework, with the aim of boosting long-term prosperity\n\u00a0More efficient services and fiscal sustainability. Modernisation of the public sector in accordance with changed needs and conditions. Digitisation of services and strengthening of local government structure. Ensuring resilience against unforeseen shocks with debt reduction and fiscal sustainability, so that the burden will not be borne by future generations.\n\n\u00a0\nStrong foundations\nThe Government\u2019s ability to respond to this economic crisis is based not least on the Treasury\u2019s strong position at the beginning of the pandemic. In recent years, Iceland\u2019s economic framework has been strengthened systematically with tax cuts, simplification of the regulatory framework, fortification of the economic policy framework, and reduction of public debt. In addition, increased GDP growth has been used to strengthen public services and further shore up the strong social welfare system that has been challenged in the past year. \n\nPublic services and the transfer system have not been cut back despite a large operating deficit. At the same time, special support has been provided to the households and businesses that have been most profoundly affected by the pandemic. \n\nBecause of this strong, systematic response, domestic demand contracted less than 2% and households\u2019 disposable income increased in 2020. The outlook is for the economy to grow by nearly 5% in 2022, and a large share of the pandemic-induced contraction in GDP looks set to be recouped in the next few years, especially if the most optimistic scenario in the fiscal plan materialises.\nContraction much smaller than forecast\nNew figures from Statistics Iceland show that the year-2020 contraction was smaller than had been forecast. These figures indicate that the Treasury deficit totalled about ISK 200bn, or 6.6% of GDP, in 2020 \u2013 some ISK 70bn less than was projected in November and December. This is due in part to more positive economic developments and stronger private consumption than had been anticipated. \n\nIn 2021, the Treasury outcome is expected to be negative by 10.2% of GDP, which is broadly in line with the estimates in the fiscal budget and the fiscal plan for 2021-2025, which assumed a deficit of 10.6% of GDP. During the horizon of the fiscal plan, it is also assumed that the outlook for the Treasury and public sector will be more favourable than before. \n\nThe fiscal plan assumes that the Treasury outcome will gradually improve until the primary balance turns positive in 2025. In 2026, the outcome is expected to be negative by ISK 59bn, or 1.4% of GDP, at which time it will have improved by nearly 9% of GDP since 2021. \n\nThe prospect of a better outcome also entails that the need for consolidation measures to halt debt accumulation by end-2025 will decline by one-fifth, to ISK 102bn. \nThe fiscal plan states that temporary economic support will be continued as needed until the economy has rebounded satisfactorily. The objective, however, is to scale down special support measures rapidly in 2022, as firms become increasingly able to operate without support.\nA stronger recovery in 2022 and 2023\nThe economic recovery is projected to be weaker in 2021 but stronger in 2022 and 2023, when it will be driven by rising tourist numbers. A total of 720,000 tourist arrivals are projected this year, a 50% increase relative to 2020.\nAccording to Statistics Iceland\u2019s final forecast prior to the fiscal plan, GDP growth is set to measure 2.6% this year,\n4.8% in 2022, and 3.8% in 2023. Based on that forecast and forecasts from the beginning of 2020, GDP will still be ISK 130bn less in 2024 than it would have been if the pandemic had not occurred.\nDebt accumulation halted in four years\nIn the next few years, Treasury debt will increase markedly, yet the debt position will nevertheless improve relative to the last fiscal plan. This is due to greater economic resilience than was widely expected and a strong economic rebound, which will cause public debt to rise less steeply than was assumed at the time of the last fiscal plan. Debt is expected to peak at 54% of GDP in 2025 instead of the more than 60% provided for in the previous fiscal plan. Furthermore, the Treasury outcome is expected to by ISK 60bn stronger in 2021-2025, even though it is assumed that measures to halt debt collection by more than ISK 7bn per year in 2023-2025 will be scaled back relative to the last fiscal plan.\n\nIn coming years, continued emphasis will be placed on public sector reform, not least through the use of digital services and information technology. In the Government\u2019s investment initiative, ISK 12bn have been earmarked for such projects in 2020-2025. This investment will deliver not only improved communications between the Government and the public, but also financial benefits for households, businesses, and \u2013 last, but not least \u2013 the Treasury. The success achieved in adopting this new technology and in recouping the output lost due to the pandemic, including with Government measures, will determine how extensive performance-enhancing measures will have to be in order to halt debt accumulation during the horizon of the fiscal plan.\nJob creation the key task\nHigh, protracted unemployment is one of the biggest problems Icelandic society faces. Unemployment roared after the COVID-19 pandemic struck, even though some weakening occurred beforehand, particularly in the tourism sector. Unemployment is projected to measure between 4% and 5% by the end of the horizon. This is somewhat above the average of recent decades, as well as a probable indication of persistently higher unemployment than Iceland has been accustomed to, if no action is taken. This trend is due in part to the fact that the impact of the pandemic is longer-lasting than originally hoped; therefore, it is clear that more people will be outside the labour market for a longer period of time. Partly because of this, the Government has strongly emphasised measures enabling job-seekers to add to their skills and education. Furthermore, broad-based job creation measures have recently been announced, with particular focus on the long-term unemployed. These measures are expected to create roughly 7,000 jobs through end-2021.\nSafeguarding social welfare and moving forwards\nThe fiscal plan for 2022-2026 reflects the strategy of the past four years, which has been adopted by a Government spanning the entire political spectrum from left to right. The plan reflects both the priorities and the progress that have been achieved with the Government platform. The platform laid down a strategy of strengthening the social welfare system, embarking on large-scale infrastructure investment, and lowering taxes, as well as setting ambitious environmental goals. The scope afforded by a period of robust GDP growth was used to fulfil promises of increased welfare and purchasing power, and the resilience of the economy has simultaneously boosted with significant debt reduction.\nDuring its term in office, the Government has emphasised broad-based social infrastructure development. This includes strengthening healthcare services, strengthening the educational system at the upper secondary and university levels, placing increased emphasis on research and development, introducing a major transportation initiative, strengthening various law enforcement and border-related projects, increasing regional development funding, building up infrastructure at tourist destinations and increasing patrolling, and taking environmental action. During the term, spending on functions has been increased by more than ISK 80bn in real terms, of 12%. \n\n\nKey priorities during the Government\u2019s term in office\n\u00a0\n\nAllocations to innovation, research, and knowledge sectors have increased more than 70%.\nThe secondary and tertiary educational system has been strengthened, and legislation on a new Student Loan Fund has been passed.\nAllocations to transportation and telecommunications have increased by over 60% in real terms, from ISK 36bn to nearly ISK 60bn.\nSince 2017, allocations to social, housing, and insurance affairs have been increased substantially, or by ISK 95bn.\nOperational contributions to healthcare have increased markedly and will equal nearly ISK 258bn by 2022.\nAllocations for investment in the healthcare system will be ISK 19bn higher in 2022 than in 2017, owing largely to the construction of the new Landsp\u00edtali hospital.\nAllocations for environmental affairs will be increased substantially. Among key priorities are soil conservation and wetland reclamation; furthermore, emphasis has been placed on reducing levies on eco-friendly transportation and supporting energy switching.\nAllocations and tax subsidies relating to climate action have increased by over ISK 7bn since 2017. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLevies on households and businesses have declined markedly during the term\nKey changes\n\nThe tax system was reviewed with the aim of boosting disposable income for low-income groups, boosting the competitiveness of the economy, and working towards the achievement of the Government\u2019s environmental objectives.\nThe largest single tax cut in the past four years is the change in personal income tax, which took full effect at the beginning of the year. Individuals\u2019 disposable income will be ISK 23bn higher each year of the horizon of the fiscal plan.\nThe increase is largest for the lowest-paid workers, or about ISK 120,000, with the changes. This is an important improvement, particularly during difficult times like these, and they play a large part in the fact that disposable income did not fall in 2020 despite the economic crisis.\n\u00a0Payroll taxes have fallen markedly during the term. Companies\u2019 tax burden is now about ISK 8bn lower per year than it was previously.\n\u00a0The investment tax base was reviewed, and the tax-free threshold was doubled at the turn of the year, and tax treatment of capital gains on the sale of vacation property and other second properties has been equalised.\nThe tax-free threshold for inheritance tax was increased significantly at the beginning of the year, with levies set to decline by about ISK 500m as a result.\nA bill of legislation providing greatly increased incentives for individuals and firms to support activities for the public good has been introduced and is expected to reduce Treasury revenues by about ISK 2bn per year.\n\nAgreement with municipalities extended\nEach year, in connection with the preparation of the fiscal plan, an agreement is made between the State and the municipalities on the basis of the Acton Public Finances. The current agreement was made on 30 September 2020,\nin connection with the current fiscal plan, and covers the period from 2021 through 2025.\nGiven that a short time has passed since the fiscal plan was prepared and the current agreement signed,and because there will be only minor changes stemming from the update of the outlook for the municipalities\u2019 outcome and debt position, the so-called J\u00f3nsmessunefnd has agreed that the current agreement, for 2021-2025, will remain valid for 2022-2026.\nOn the fiscal plan\nThe fiscal plan for 2022-2026, which is now introduced, is the current Government\u2019s last fiscal plan before the next Parliamentary elections. At the same time, this is the first time since the entry into force of the Act on Public Finances in 2016 that a Government has been in power for a full electoral term and has therefore been able to follow through on its economic and fiscal policies as laid down in its fiscal strategy and further developed in each year\u2019s fiscal plan and fiscal budget.\n\nThis year\u2019s fiscal plan is introduced under extraordinary circumstances. The current fiscal plan was approved later than usual, or in December, and Parliamentary elections are scheduled for September 2021. This entails that a new fiscal plan will be presented by a new Government in spring 2022, and it will be based on a new fiscal strategy, which will be introduced no later than at the time the fiscal budget proposal for 2022 is introduced. These extraordinary circumstances and the importance of the contribution of public finances to economic policy in the coming term are reflected in the fiscal plan\u2019s emphasis on re-establishing a sound fiscal situation in the next few years", "id": "d6b6925af674347a9a4903e758802021"}

By then, at least 60 percent of the population, equivalent to 75 percent of those who will be called in for vaccination, is expected to have at least received the first dose of vaccine. This takes view of the opinion of the Chief Epidemiologist that it is advisable to keep testing at the border unchanged for the time being in order to be able to start lifting the testing at the border around mid-June.\u00a0\nThe amendment to the regulation will be made that on 1st of June the compulsory stay in a quarantine facility of travellers arriving from high-risk areas will cease to apply. This is because the incidence rate of infections at the border has been steadily decreasing since the compulsory stay in a quarantine facility took effect. The number of European countries on the list of high-risk areas has also decreased. The use of quarantine facilities will therefore be as it was previously, i.e. for individuals who are obliged to undergo quarantine and who have no place to go in Iceland or who are otherwise unable or unwilling to isolate in a facility they themselves have arranged for. \nThe regulation banning unnecessary travel from specified high-risk areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic issued by the Minister of Justice will cease to apply on 1 June.\nIn this morning\u00b4s cabinet meeting it was decided that the previously announced colour-coding system at the border will not take effect. This is done because the lifting of measures at the border is anticipated to go faster against all countries, regardless of the situation of the epidemic there, since the number of those vaccinated is increasing very rapidly. Under those circumstances there is no gain in introducing a colour-coding system for only a short period of time.\nThe goal is that rapid tests will be used increasingly instead of PCR-tests for those leaving the country, whether they are Icelanders travelling abroad or foreign tourists who have stayed in Iceland.

Later this week, the Government will introduce the 2021 fiscal budget proposal before Parliament. Also to be presented is the draft parliamentary resolution for the five-year fiscal plan, which describes in greater detail how the Government intends to address these challenging conditions. The plan to be introduced contains a number of items intended to support employment-generating activity during the pandemic, promote stability in the labour market, and ensure resilience during the post-pandemic period.\nIn recent days, the Government has held discussions with the Confederation of Icelandic Employers and the Icelandic Federation of Labour concerning their assessment of the premises for the Living Standards Agreement and the near-term labour market outlook. Following those discussions, the Government has decided to introduce eight measures designed to promote social and economic stability, as well as the measures that will be announced alongside the presentation of the fiscal budget proposal and fiscal plan.\nThe Government estimates that the total cost of the measures could range up to ISK 25bn. This figure is highly uncertain, however, not least because the scope of the green investments is unknown. Furthermore, the financial support measure for businesses that have suffered severe revenue losses because of the pandemic has yet to be designed in full detail.\nThe measures are as follows:\n1. Extension of \u201cBack to Work\u201d initiative\nThe Government has decided that 100% reimbursement of value-added tax on labour, under the \u201cBack to Work\u201d campaign, will be extended through end-2021. The estimated cost of the reimbursements is roughly ISK 8bn.\n2. Temporary payroll tax reduction\nIn order to mitigate the impact of the wage rises that are to take effect at the end of this year according to the Living Standards Agreement, the Government has decided to lower the payroll tax for one year, until end-2021. The payroll tax reduction will be the equivalent of relinquishing payroll taxes on the contractual wage rises that take effect at year-end 2020. The cost of the payroll tax cut amounts to about ISK 4bn.\n3. Financial support for businesses that have suffered severe pandemic-related revenue losses\nA wide range of measures to support employment-generating activities have already been passed into law. Among them are the part-time unemployment benefits scheme, wage support during the termination notice period, closure subsidies, supplemental loans and support loans, moratoria on payment, and Government guarantees. In addition, financial institutions have been granted vastly increased scope to support businesses. It is vital that these measures be implemented in full.\u00a0\nIn recent weeks and in the wake of tightened public health measures, the Government has given particular consideration to businesses that have suffered severe revenue losses due to the pandemic, with the aim of ensuring, insofar as is possible, that they will have the capacity they need to regain a solid footing when the pandemic has passed. Consideration will be given to providing direct subsidies to companies whose revenues have collapsed because of COVID-19. With such subsidies, the aim will be to sustain necessary minimum operations while the pandemic is ongoing, thereby maintaining business relationships.These subsidies could total some ISK 6bn. Estimates will be prepared in the next few weeks and presented before Parliament no later than at the time the supplementary fiscal budget proposal is introduced.\n4. Tax concessions for investment\nWork is underway on tax concessions aimed at encouraging and supporting firms that invest in projects designed to promote innovation and competitiveness in the economy. This includes expedited write-offs of new investments, with emphasis on green transformation and climate targets, thereby enabling companies to embark on such investments much sooner than they would have otherwise. Furthermore, ways to encourage the public to participate in the economy by purchasing equity securities will be examined.\n5. Increased emphasis on innovation and food production\nIn connection with the preparation of the fiscal budget proposal, the Government has decided that allocations for innovation will be increased by roughly ISK 5bn between 2020 and 2021. This equals an increase of about ISK 10bn relative to previous years. The measure includes the establishment of Kr\u00eda, an investment fund intended to promote development, growth, and increased competitiveness in Iceland. In addition, concessions for companies engaged in research and development will be tripled relative to 2017. Moreover, allocations for innovation in food production have increased markedly, including with the establishment of the Food Fund. In this context, the Government will give particular consideration to efficiency and efficacy in food production.\u00a0\n6.\u00a0Reforms in physical planning and construction\nThe Government will introduce reforms in the areas of physical planning and construction, based in part on the findings of the task force on housing affairs and on advisory work done by the OECD for the Government concerning barriers to competition in the markets.\n7. Reforms in pension system and labour market\nPursuant to the Government\u2019s statement in connection with the Living Standards Agreement and discussions with labour market federations, the previously announced bill of legislation on legalisation of premiums, equal status of pension fund members vis-\u00e0-vis the social security system, and authorisations for the allocation of specified third-pillar pension savings towards home purchases will be introduced before Parliament at the autumn legislative session. Thereafter, the Government will lead strategy formulation in the pension system, in close cooperation with labour market federations and the National Association of Pension Funds. The objective is to publish the results of this consultation in a green paper on pension affairs, to be introduced in spring 2021. The Government will also lead the preparation of a green paper on the future environment for wage agreements and labour market affairs, in close cooperation with labour market federations. The green book on the labour market is also to be published in spring 2021.\n8.\u00a0Presentation of bills of legislation in support of the Living Standards Agreement\nIn accordance with the Government\u2019s statement in connection with the Living Standards Agreement, bills of legislation on employment terms, rent, amendments to the Bankruptcy Act (switching company ID numbers), and amendments to the Act on Interest and Price Indexation are to be introduced before Parliament in the autumn.", "id": "da8638610be435e4bab9e87e46b70c25"}

The Prime Minister presented the one-year Presidency programme to the Session of the Nordic Council that took place in Helsinki this week. Iceland will take over the Presidency from Norway on 1 January 2023.\nThe headline of Iceland\u2019s Presidency will be: \u201cThe Nordic Region \u2013 A Force for Peace\u201d. Iceland's Presidency will focus on the three priority areas of a green, competitive and socially sustainable Nordic Region, including efforts to support a green and just transition, with the participation of every generation.\nThe Icelandic Presidency will highlight the importance of peace as the prerequisite for welfare, human rights, and environmental protection. This emphasis is largely determined by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has completely altered the security situation in the West.\u00a0Such circumstances make the solidarity and co-operation of the Nordic nations vitally important.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Nordic nations are at their strongest when they join forces. Not only does Nordic co-operation deliver results - it also brings us enjoyment and builds bridges between inhabitants of the region, in areas such as gender equality, the environment and universal welfare in our societies,\u201d stated Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir and Gu\u00f0mundur Ingi Gu\u00f0brandsson, Minister for Nordic Co-operation, in their joint address.\nIceland\u2019s programme for the Presidency is founded upon on the Nordic Council of Ministers Vision 2030, which has the overarching objective for the Nordic Region to become the world\u2019s most sustainable and integrated region. The action plan describes how the Nordic Council of Ministers will work to achieve the objectives of the vision through the vision\u2019s three strategic priorities: a green Nordic Region, a competitive Nordic Region, and a socially sustainable Nordic Region. The co-operation within the Nordic Council of Ministers is intended to serve this purpose.\nThe focus areas include a just transition, a green transition in the fisheries sector and in the utilisation of maritime resources, an inclusive labour market, the strengthening and development of cultural activities and the arts by promoting innovation and increasing relations between artists, developing a common Nordic policy on digital language technology, and the equality and rights of LGBTQI+ people with an emphasis on issues concerning transgender and intersex people. Co-operation between the West Nordic countries will also be a focus point during the Presidency.\n\u201cThere is widespread support for Nordic co-operation in the Nordic Region and for generations of people, this is how it has always been. We may have a tendency for taking this collaboration for granted, for Nordic co-operation requires time and effort and should not be taken as a given. It is the result of discussion, work, and joint decisions which, taken together, make us stronger as one region. The future vision for Nordic co-operation up until 2030 of becoming the most sustainable and most integrated region in the world, is an example of such a joint decision, which will create numerous opportunities in the coming years,\u201d Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir and Gu\u00f0mundur Ingi Gu\u00f0brandsson, Minister for Nordic Co-operation, also stated in their joint address.\nThe Presidency is a far-reaching and highly important project that concerns every ministry within the Government of Iceland through Iceland\u2019s participation in the Nordic Council of Ministers\u2019 ministerial committees and committees of senior officials.\nIceland last held the Presidency of the Nordic Council of Ministers in 2019, which is when the 2030 Vision was adopted.

We need to stay the course and maintain and increase our support for Ukraine as they defend their freedom. Their cause is our cause. \nThe Nordic countries have since the beginning of the invasion supported Ukraine with lethal and non-lethal military materiel, humanitarian aid and funds. This support will continue. We remain steadfast in supporting Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity. We will not let Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric or aggressive actions deter our support to Ukraine. The Nordic countries have in total, donated approximately 1.7 billion euros in defence related support to Ukraine. \nToday we have also discussed the future of Nordic defence cooperation in light of Finland and Sweden\u2019s application to join NATO. Finnish and Swedish NATO membership will strengthen Nordic defence cooperation and benefit the security of the whole Alliance.

{"date": "September 06, 2019", "title": "Fiscal budget proposal for 2020: Strong investment and tax reductions", "content": "Personal income tax lowered \u2014 reduction process expedited\nPayroll tax lowered\nStrong public investment\nTransportation strengthened \nResearch strengthened\nSupport for low-income housing\nContinued reduction of Treasury debt\nIncentives for energy exchange\n\nThe fiscal budget proposal for 2020 is introduced today and will be presented before Parliament on Tuesday 10 September 2019. The introduction has not previously taken place in as timely a manner prior to the first round of discussions. The purpose is to accede to the wishes of members of Parliament for more advance notice to acquaint themselves with the topic.\nAmong the salient features of the proposal is that the personal income tax (PIN) will be lowered more rapidly than previously planned, with the full reduction achieved by 2021 instead of 2022. This measure will increase disposable income for the lowest-income persons by just over ISK 120,000. The total annual scope of the measure is about ISK 21bn, or about 10% of the Treasury\u2019s PIN-generated revenues. This is an important element in supporting households when the economy slows down.\u00a0\nIn addition to the reduction in the PIN is the latter phase of the 0.5 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax, which was lowered by 0.25 percentage points at the beginning of 2019. By the turn of the year, the payroll tax will have been lowered from 7.69% in 2013 to 6.35%, supporting job creation and shoring up firms\u2019 operational foundations.\nProgress and higher living standards\nMany important matters are supported, including funding for changes to the Student Loan Fund, launching of measures to encourage recruitment of teachers and strengthen internships, and increased allocations to scientific and research collaboration.\nA major push in road construction lies ahead, and the aim is to participate in the cost of domestic air travel for residents of regional Iceland.\u00a0\nEnergy exchange will be strengthened with tax concessions and grants from the Energy Fund. Allocations for climate change issues increase and, among other things, will be used for carbon sequestration with afforestation, soil conservation, and wetland reclamation. Allocations to patrolling and the highland national park will also increase.\u00a0\nMeasures aimed at increasing nursing staff will be prepared, measures supporting community healthcare centres as the first port of call will continue, and nursing home construction will continue.\u00a0\nContinued work will be done to enhance the quality of service to disabled children and their parents, and allocations to improve disability pensioners\u2019 standards of living will be increased in line with previous plans. Labour participation by the elderly will be supported, parents\u2019 childbirth leave entitlement will be lengthened, and child benefits will be increased.\u00a0\nAllocations to housing affairs will be ensured, in connection with the recent standard of living agreements, and measures are proposed in response to housing problems in regional Iceland.\nOverall outcome in balance\nIt is planned that the overall Treasury outcome will be in balance in 2020, which is consistent with the recent revision of the five-year fiscal strategy, although the planned Treasury operating surplus will shrink. This is done in order to create the conditions for the economy to rebalance earlier and to gain a footing for a new GDP growth period, with an eye towards fostering stability and improved living standards.\nEnvironmental and climate issues\nEmphasis on climate and environmental affairs show clearly: allocations to environmental affairs have increased by over 24% in real terms since the Government took office. They have delivered, among other things, broad-based climate change measures, major infrastructure development in protected areas, and increased patrolling. Also noteworthy are positive incentives relating to the environment, including increased support for the purchase of home charging stations and rental of environment-friendly vehicles. \nWelfare and healthcare in the foreground\nIn connection with the finalisation of private sector wage settlements, the Government issued a statement on measures to support the settlements. The total scope of proposed measures over the term of the contracts is estimated at ISK 80bn, including just over ISK 16bn in 2020. In addition to the changes in the tax system that were introduced during the prelude to the wage settlements, the Government\u2019s measures include longer childbirth leave, higher child benefits, and a number of measures to facilitate home purchases. Most of these measures will take effect in 2020 and will be manifested in increased allocations \u2014 to social and housing affairs in particular.\nCountercyclical measures\nThe strong fiscal position enables the authorities to boost the resilience of the economy and counterbalance the downward cycle with strong public investment during this time of reduced business investment. Allocations to investment total just over ISK 78bn, an increase in real terms of ISK 27bn since 2017.\nLarge projects include the following:\n\nInvestment in transportation, ISK 28bn\nIncreased investment in the construction of Landsp\u00edtali hospital, ISK 8.5bn\nPurchase of helicopters for the Coast Guard\nAllocations for the construction of a new marine research vessel\nConstruction of Icelandic House, the centre for Icelandic studies.\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s scope to respond to the slowdown in the economy is due first and foremost to disciplined fiscal management in recent years. The positive outcome, the stability contributions in connection with capital account liberalisation, and other irregular income items such as dividend payments have been used to effect a substantial reduction in Treasury debt, which is estimated at 22% in 2020. \nThe flexible ISK exchange rate pulls in the same direction, as does the falling Central Bank key interest rate, which has never been lower. Furthermore, the social partners have contributed with the recent wage settlements, which further support economic stability. \nIncreased confidence in the authorities\u2019 economic management and policy has also been reflected in the strong credit rating of the Treasury, which has never been offered such favourable terms in bond markets. \nPresentation of fiscal budget proposal\nThe National Budget is based on a fiscal strategy and a fiscal plan. Two documents are presented: the fiscal budget proposal itself and a supplement. The supplement shows, among other things, the distribution of budgetary authorisations among Part A entities, projects, and a reserve fund for functions.", "id": "e1fc0166748e36d7b2656d4ee2a2971b"}

{"date": "September 11, 2018", "title": "National Budget proposal 2019", "content": "Treasury operated at ISK 29bn surplus\nReduced levies on wage-earners \u2014 personal deduction to increase\nChild benefits to increase\nHealthcare in the forefront\n\nIncreased allocations to healthcare\nMental health services strengthened\nIncreased allocations to construction of new Landsp\u00edtali hospital \nEmphasis on nursing homes: construction and operations\n\n\nAllocations to social, housing, and insurance affairs are increased \nISK 25bn in support for housing\nContinued deleveraging\nEmphasis on infrastructure investment \nIncreased allocations for climate issues\n\nPositive outcome despite growing expenditures\nThe National Budget proposal for 2019 is being submitted to Parliament today. It is assumed that the overall Treasury surplus will be 1% of year-2019 GDP, or approximately ISK 29bn. This is in line with the targets in the fiscal strategy (link) and fiscal plan (link), as Treasury operations have been in surplus in recent years despite a substantial increase in expenditures \u2014 particularly healthcare, social, insurance, and housing affairs.\nIn all, total Treasury expenditures will rise by 7% year-on-year in nominal terms, or by just over ISK 55bn, whereas total Treasury revenues will increase by nearly ISK 52bn. It is clear that this is close to the upper limit of possible spending growth. This spending growth will be addressed with regular reassessments of expenditures so as to ensure the best possible allocation of funds.\n\nHighlights\n\nBudgetary allocations to healthcare will rise in 2019, with the bulk of the increase for the construction of the new Landsp\u00edtali hospital (ISK 7.2bn in 2019). In addition, allocations for the construction and operation of nursing homes will be increased. The total increase in budgetary healthcare contributions between 2018 and 2019 is ISK 12.6bn, excluding wage and price changes. In addition, allocations to social, housing, and insurance affairs will increase by ISK 13.3bn, excluding wage and price changes.\nInvestment in infrastructure will continue to be emphasised. In addition to the construction of the new Landsp\u00edtali on Hringbraut, it is assumed that allocations for transport will increase by ISK 5.5bn, due mainly to a special transport campaign in 2019-2021, which will be financed with temporary extraordinary dividends paid by financial institutions, as was specified in the current fiscal plan. Allocations to transport and telecommunications will be increased by 9% in 2019, to just over ISK 43.6bn. \nOther large investment projects include the first contributions for the purchase of new Coast Guard helicopters, whose delivery is scheduled for 2022, and the construction of Icelandic House, the centre for Icelandic studies. \nOver ISK 25bn for housing support\nSupport for housing is to increase by just over ISK 900m next year. The subsidy, which will total ISK 25.4bn, is provided in various ways, including housing benefits, initial contributions for apartment construction, and mortgage interest allowances. Housing support is also provided with tax benefits through the third-pillar pension savings measure and support for first-time purchases, tax exemptions for rental income, discounted stamp fees for first-time purchases, reimbursement of value-added tax to builders for the sale and rental of residential housing, and reimbursement of value-added tax to homeowners for maintenance.\nReduced levies on wage-earners\nNext year, work will begin on the first stages in reforming the interaction between the income tax and benefits systems, one of the Government\u2019s policy priorities. In February, the government stated that, in connection with the review of private sector wage settlements, a review of the income tax system would begin, with emphasis on reducing tax burdens and making possible changes to both the personal deduction and the relationship with the benefits system, so as to support lower-income groups. As a result, it is proposed that, concurrent with this budget proposal, actions be taken so as to facilitate labour market negotiations. \nIt is proposed that the personal deduction be increased by 1 percentage point in excess of the legally mandated twelve-month rise in the consumer price index in 2019. It is also assumed that the increase in the upper tax bracket boundary be based on the consumer price index (CPI), as linking the upper tax bracket boundary to the wage index creates a certain inconsistency, in that the personal deduction and the tax-free threshold follow the CPI. This is now being addressed by linking the boundary of the upper bracket to the CPI. This will create greater equality among different income groups vis-\u00e0-vis the tax system, and individuals\u2019 tax payments will decline by ISK 1.7bn. \nAlongside the increase in the personal deduction and the linking of the upper tax bracket boundary to the CPI, child benefits will be increased significantly, or by ISK 1.6bn over and above the current fiscal budget. This represents a 16% increase between 2018 and 2019. In addition to increased amounts and reference limits for curtailing child benefits, the budget assumes a new bracket for curtailing child benefits, so as to ensure that the increase will primarily benefit low-income and lower-middle-income groups. Mortgage interest allowances will increase as well, by 13% over and above the projected outcome for 2018.\nIn connection with the presentation of the fiscal budget proposal for 2019, it is proposed that the payroll tax be reduced by 0.25 percentage points at the beginning of 2019, and by another 0.25 percentage points at the beginning of 2020. This translates to a combined 9.3% reduction in the payroll tax. This measure is intended to promote stability and balance in the labour market, so as to mitigate the inflationary impact of next year\u2019s wage increases.\nFavourable economic situation\nEven though GDP growth is easing, it remains robust, and well above the growth levels projected for most of the advanced economies in Europe. The economy is strong by most measures, as is reflected in credit rating agencies\u2019 assessment of the sovereign. Iceland\u2019s credit ratings have risen steadily in recent years, to the current A/A-1 and A from S&P Global and Fitch, with a stable outlook, and A3 with a positive outlook from Moody\u2019s. The current credit ratings are based on high national income, strong institutions, a good standard of living, and a sound business environment.\n\n\nSystematic deleveraging\nTreasury debt has fallen rapidly in recent years. Total debt has declined by ISK 658bn in six years, and the debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen from the 2011 peak of 86% to 31% as of the end of this year. From mid-2017 through mid-2018, Treasury debt declined by ISK 88bn, which translates to a reduction of ISK 10m per hour. Because of these measures, Treasury debt will fall below the reference in the fiscal rule in the Act on Public Finances for the first time in 2019. The outlook is for net interest expense to be ISK 26bn lower in 2019 than in 2011.\n\nIn addition to the reduction in Treasury debt, large amounts have been paid on pension obligations, which increases long-term fiscal sustainability and helps prevent current generations from raising their standards of living at the expense of future generations. The planned establishment of a Sovereign Wealth Fund by statute at this legislative session, with the intention of collecting dividends from energy resources, can support this fiscal sustainability goal.\nPresentation of fiscal budget proposal\nThe National Budget is based on a fiscal strategy and a fiscal plan. Two documents are presented: the budget proposal itself and a supplement. The supplement shows, among other things, the distribution of budgetary authorisations among Part A entities, projects, and a reserve fund for functions.", "id": "e31c37d4587a3725acf823a19b5d1b6d"}

The Minister discussed the report with his Greenlandic counterpart, Steen Lynge on Wednesday.\nGudlaugur Th\u00f3r Th\u00f3rrdarson, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development Co-operation of Iceland, appointed the committee in April 2019. It is chaired by \u00d6ssur Skarph\u00e9dinsson, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Unnur Br\u00e1 Konr\u00e1dsdottir and \u00d3ttarr Gudlaugsson were also on the committee.\nIn the report, Greenland and Iceland in the New Arctic, the committee prioritizes ten recommendations for policy development. It is also recommended that at the outset the countries establish a framework agreement and that the Icelandic Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development Co-operation introduces a Parliamentary resolution on a Greenland Policy.\nThe report contains all together 99 recommendations on possible actions for increased cooperation between government, local authorities, agencies and institutions, private sector, non-governmental organisations, sports, arts, and culture.\n\nAccording to Minister Th\u00f3rdarson, the report marks a turning point as by far the most comprehensive analysis of bilateral relations and co-operation between the two countries ever.\n\u201cI believe it is crucial to start as soon as possible a dialogue and collaboration with Greenlandic authorities on the implementation of the recommendations. The recommendations provide a good base to define common priorities and common topics for the two countries to work on,\u201d says Minister Th\u00f3rdarson.\u00a0\nThe recommendations of the committee are based on a detailed analysis of the countries bilateral relations and the status of the region in the new Arctic.

Those who are unable to stay in a home quarantine that fulfils the requirements will need to stay at a quarantine facility. However,\u00a0no fee shall be collected for the stay. This is among the stipulations of a new regulation issued by the Minister of Health that entered\u00a0into force on the 9th of April and is based on recommendations\u00a0from the Chief Epidemiologist. The principal aim is to reduce as possible the risk of bringing infections to the country by measures allowed by the Health Security and Communicable Diseases Act. The regulation repeals regulation no. 355/2021 which entered into force on the 1st of April, including provisions requiring individuals from risk zones to stay in a quarantine facility which were deemed to have had insufficient legal basis by the District Court of Reykjavik.\u00a0\n\nAccording to a memorandum from the Chief Epidemiologist to the Minister of Health, insufficient compliance with the rules applicable to home quarantine, constitutes the largest threat to the current measures to contain the spread of infections at the borders. There is a significant risk that infections will be brought to the country unless further measures are introduced at the borders. It is noted that the vaccination rate is not sufficient here in Iceland to prevent a widespread epidemic and the epidemic is spreading fast in most countries which in turn increases the risk of infections being brought to Iceland. Furthermore, new and more contagious variants of the virus have become pervasive in nearby countries which seem to cause more serious illness in younger groups of the population in addition to the prevailing uncertainty about whether they can cause re-infections and about the level of protection provided by the existing vaccines against them. \nThe main rules on quarantine and testing at the borders as from the 9th of April\nThe same rules apply to all passengers irrespective of from where they are travelling:\u00a0Measures to contain the spread of infections at the borders apply equally to all passengers coming from countries\u00a0identified as risk zones\u00a0by the Chief Epidemiologist.\nTesting and quarantine: Everyone arriving to the country shall be tested at the borders as before, quarantine for five days and undergo a second test upon finishing (see below special requirements that apply to children and individuals carrying certificates of vaccination or prior infection). People\u00a0are allowed to\u00a0quarantine at home if certain requirements are fulfilled. Those who cannot quarantine at home and/or prefer to stay at a quarantine facility may stay there without charge.\u00a0\nRequirements for home quarantine:\u00a0Those quarantining at home need to stay in a facility that fulfils the conditions and rules of conduct provided for in the new instructions issued by the Chief Epidemiologist.\u00a0These include that the individual shall be isolated at the place of stay and if more individuals reside at the same\u00a0location\u00a0they are subject to the same requirements that apply to quarantine.\u00a0Those who are unable to stay in a home quarantine that fulfils the requirements, shall stay at a quarantine facility.\u00a0\nBreach of home quarantine:\u00a0Where an individual is found in breach of home quarantine the Chief Epidemiologist may decide that the quarantine shall be concluded at a quarantine facility.\u00a0\nQuarantine facility:\u00a0Those who cannot quarantine at home and/or prefer to stay at a quarantine facility may dwell there. The stay is free of charge. Those staying at a quarantine facility will be enabled\u00a0to undertake outdoor activities and special consideration will be given to children in relation to outdoor activities and other conditions.\u00a0\nTesting and quarantine of children:\u202fChildren born in 2005 or later shall be tested at the borders. A child who travels with an individual who is subject to stay in quarantine shall stay with that person and can leave the quarantine if the second test of its co-traveller is negative. When the co-traveller is not required to stay in quarantine the same shall apply to the child. A child travelling alone is not required to stay in quarantine.\nTesting of individuals carrying a certificate:\u202fThe requirement of testing individuals carrying a vaccination certificate, or a certificate of prior infection is adopted due to indications that those individuals can pass on infections. They must wait for the result of the test at their place of residence and follow quarantine rules until the result is available.\u00a0The requirement is temporary and will be reviewed before the 1st of May.\nIncreased surveillance and higher fines\nThe Chief Epidemiologist proposes increased surveillance of individuals in home quarantine in cooperation with the Police\u2019s Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management and a significant increase of fines for breaching home quarantine.

It has been instrumental in preventing and solving conflicts, promoting peace, human rights, equality, and socioeconomic development for all. \nIceland joined the United Nations in 1946 and has benefitted greatly from the role the UN has played in shaping the rule-based international order with its multilateral institutions, liberal democracy, and international cooperation. \nI firmly believe that international law and the principles and values of the UN Charter, reinforced by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights still provide the best foundation for international cooperation. We must continue to build unity, solidarity and to foster understanding between peoples and nations, which is the foundation for lasting peace and underscores our common humanity.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic spreads around the world it reinforces the core values of the United Nations, the notion that all people should be supported and cared for. \nIn rebuilding and reimagining the world after COVID-19, we must keep issues of gender equality, and of racial equality, at the forefront. Accessible health-care for all is crucial \u2013 not only as a public health issue, but also as a security issue. When economic crises hit, we often see the tendency to put social justice and equality, along with environmental issues, on the back burner. But equality and environmental issues must be front and central to all our planning. \nOur future must be based on well-being and inclusive sustainable growth, with a focus on protecting our planet from the devastating effects of climate change. Agenda 2030 is the global plan for fulfilling our commitments to each other and our planet, allowing all people to live in dignity under conditions of equality where they can reach their full potential, safeguarding peace and prosperity, protecting our environment, and taking meaningful actions against climate change. \nMultilateral cooperation has indeed never been more important. Let us reject the dividing forces of polarization and populism.\nAs we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, let us remember the core values on which it was built. Let us recommit to the principles of the UN-Charter, to build trust and strengthen our cooperation to build a greener and more equitable future for coming generations, a future with a healthy planet, plentiful opportunities and prosperity for all.", "id": "e81800ec26ca31e5acd89d688ca03873"}

The senior unsecured foreign-currency rating has also been affirmed at A2, and the foreign-currency senior unsecured MTN program has been affirmed at (P)A2. The outlook on the ratings remains stable. \n\nThe rating affirmation at A2 balances the following key drivers: 1. The Icelandic economy is expected to post a solid recovery helped by a strong and pro-active policy response; over the coming years economic growth will be supported by strong investment and the continuing recovery in the tourism sector; 2. Institutions have been strengthened significantly and their credibility has materially improved over the past years; Moody\u2019s considers this driver to be a Governance consideration under its ESG framework; 3. The limited diversification of the economy due to its small size implies, in Moody\u2019s view, a high growth volatility and exposure to sector-specific shocks; while diversification efforts are ongoing this is unlikely to materially change over the coming years, in Moody\u2019s view. \n\nThe stable outlook reflects broadly balanced risks. Apart from a solid economic recovery and a robust growth outlook, the government\u2019s strong track record on debt reduction gives confidence that it will manage to reverse the pandemic-induced fiscal deterioration over the coming years. Last year\u2019s contraction was less severe than initially feared also because other key sectors beyond tourism of the economy proved more resilient. Iceland\u2019s relatively high public debt level is partly the result of an accounting reclassification in late 2020, which does not change the government\u2019s fundamental fiscal profile. \n\nThe local-currency ceilings remain unchanged at Aa1, set at four notches above the sovereign rating. Moody\u2019s has raised Iceland\u2019s foreign-currency ceilings to Aa2 from Aa3, to reflect the full abolition of capital controls with the updated Foreign Currency Act No 70/2021 in late June 2021.\n\nThe outlook on Iceland\u2019s rating could move to positive and the rating could eventually be upgraded in case of faster-than-expected progress in restoring the government's fiscal buffers. Moreover, a push towards increased diversification which would lead to a less volatile economic performance would be positive for the rating. \n\nConversely, outlook and rating would come under downward pressure if the authorities deviated significantly from their current medium-term fiscal consolidation plans that target a stabilisation of the public debt ratio by the middle of the decade, resulting in a material increase in the public debt ratio. An economic shock which would lead to a large and permanent damage to the tourism industry, or to substantial capital outflows, weakening Iceland\u2019s external position and threatening financial stability, would also be credit negative, although the latter is not a likely scenario.\n\nMoody's Press release", "id": "ea532a26707232b084206e5f64299931"}

Restaurants and nightclubs, pubs and other places that have an alcohol licence must close no later than 21.00h (9 p.m.). Public swimming pools and spas, gyms and ski areas will be permitted to accept 50% of their maximum allowed capacity. Events requiring rapid tests will be limited to 200 persons. Remote working will be encouraged, to the extent possible. This is the gist of the stricter domestic measures decided by the Minister of Health in keeping with the recommendations of the Chief Epidemiologist to counter the rapid spread of COVID-19 infections. A regulation to that effect will enter into force on Thursday, 23 December, and will remain in force for three weeks.\nCOVID-19 infections have been increasing rapidly in Iceland in the last few days and there have been, on average, around and over 200 per day. On 18 December, some 150 persons had been diagnosed with the Omicron variant of the virus, which is at least twice as infectious as the Delta variant. It is now spreading rapidly within our neighbouring countries. It is now the cause of around 30% of all infections in Denmark, with between 8,000 and 11,000 cases being diagnosed every day. The result is a rise in hospitalisations Denmark, and according to the Chief Epidemiologist\u2019s memorandum, it looks like a new record will be set soon. Omicron is expected to become the dominant variant of the epidemic in Iceland in the coming weeks, much as it has done in other countries. Although there are indications that Omicron causes a milder illness than Delta does, it is probable that its rapid spread will mean that a great number of people will have to be hospitalised, even though serious cases are less frequent than due to the other variants. The Chief Epidemiologist also points out that according to the research, two vaccinations provide little to no protection against the Omicron variant. A booster vaccination increases the protection considerably, but it is unclear how good that protection is and how long it will last. The Chief Epidemiologist states: \u201cI therefore consider it inevitable to impose stricter domestic measures as quickly as possible, before the rise in infections causes an emergency situation in hospitals and other infrastructures.\u201d\u00a0\nThe main content of the new disease prevention rules is as follows:\n\nThe general restriction on numbers will be 20 persons, including children.\nThe rule on social distancing will be 2 metres. Children born in 2016 and after will be exempt from this rule. The social distancing rule in restaurants and among guests at sit-down events will be 1 metre.\nMask requirement: The general rule is that a mask shall be used if the 2 metre distancing rule can not be respected, and masks must be work inside shops and shopping centres. Children born in 2006 and after will be exempt from using face masks. \nEvents requiring rapid tests: Organised events may be held with up to 200 persons in each disease prevention compartment, subject to the use of rapid tests.\nSit-down events without rapid tests: The maximum number of people is 50. Examples include performing art events, film shows, sports events and sit-down ceremonies held by religious and life stance organisations.\nShops and museums may receive 50 persons in each compartment.

The same applies to private parties at venues that have an alcohol licence. The social distancing rule for seated guests in restaurants is 1 metre.\nSwimming pools, spas, gyms and ski areas: They are permitted to admit 50% of their maximum capacity. Children born in 2016 and after are not included in that number.\u00a0\n\nSchools\n\nThe maximum permitted number of children/students at all school levels is 50 in each compartment. \nThe maximum permitted number of staff in the same space will be 20, and staff members may move between compartments. \nSocial distancing: The general rule is a distance of 2 metres, but masks must be used if the 2 metre rule is can not be respected. Pre-school children are exempted from social distancing.\nMask requirement: The general rule is that face masks are required if the 2 metre rule is can not be respected. Children born in 2006 and after will be exempt from using face masks.\u00a0\n\nPerforming arts and choirs\n\nRehearsals and shows where people touch are permitted with up to 50 workers on stage. Masks shall be used to the extent possible, except during a performance, and efforts must be made to respect the 2 metre rule.\nAudience numbers: Up to 50 audience members may be received into each compartment, with every person wearing a mask and subject to numbered seating. 100 children in addition to 50 adults may be allowed into the same compartment without requiring rapid tests.

If the bill is passed into law, this will provide expanded authorisations for withdrawals from accounts subject to special restrictions. These expanded authorisations are of three types. First is a general authorisation for all holders of offshore kr\u00f3nur to release their offshore kr\u00f3na assets in order to purchase foreign currency and export it to an account abroad. Second is an authorisation for offshore kr\u00f3na holders that have owned offshore kr\u00f3na assets continuously since 28 November 2008 to release those offshore kr\u00f3na assets from the legal restrictions. Third is an authorisation for individuals to withdraw up to 100 m.kr. from accounts subject to special restrictions. The amendments proposed here are based on the requirement that the efficacy of the special reserve requirement on capital inflows not be undermined. \nThe Act on the Treatment of Kr\u00f3na-Denominated Assets Subject to Special Restrictions, no. 37/2016, entered into force on 22 May 2016. The Act was an important element in the authorities\u2019 capital account liberalisation strategy. When the Act entered into force, it was foreseen that the restrictions it provided for would be temporary measures and that the authorities would once again aim to lift the capital controls on offshore kr\u00f3na assets when conditions warranted it. The authorities have worked systematically and in various ways to solve the problem represented by offshore kr\u00f3na assets during the capital account liberalisation process, and the stock of offshore kr\u00f3na assets has been reduced substantially, or from 319 b.kr. to 84 b.kr.\nChanges in implementation of the special reserve requirement on capital inflows\nThe proposed amendment allows for increased flexibility concerning the form of the special reserve requirement on new inflows of foreign currency, but it does not provide for changes in the holding period or the special reserve ratio.\nUntil now, the parties concerned were required to satisfy the special reserve requirement by depositing funds to a term deposit account with a deposit institution. This arrangement is considered, among other things, to have complicated matters for investors interested in investing in Iceland, as in some instances they are not authorised to invest if they cannot sell the investment at any time. In order to respond to this, it is proposed that it be made possible to satisfy the special reserve requirement via repo transactions with Central Bank certificates of deposit. Furthermore, the new arrangement allows investors to release funds during the holding period by settling with a financial institution. It will remain possible to satisfy the special reserve requirement by depositing funds to a term deposit account in the same manner as before.", "id": "ece6a1bbda483afeb169f12fbf285dd5"}

These are the highlights of the new anti-Covid measures that are due to take effect on Tuesday, 25 May according to a decision by the Minister of Health, based on recommendations from the Chief Epidemiologist. The regulation setting out the changes is to remain in force until 16 June.\n\nIn his memorandum to the minister, the Chief Epidemiologist stressed that even though few new infections have been detected recently, the corona virus has not been eliminated in Iceland. Consequently, it is necessary to proceed with caution when relaxing the preventive measures until a larger number of people (c. 220,000, or 60-70% of the population) have received at least one vaccination. This point is expected to be reached in the second half of June.\nPrincipal changes on 25 May:\n\nBelow are the main changes that are due to take effect on 25 May. \nIt should be noted that the current requirements regarding the registration of guests and customers will remain in force.\n\nThe general restriction on numbers at gatherings will rise from 50 to 150 persons. Restrictions will not apply to children born in or after 2015.\n\nSocial distancing: The 2-metre social distancing rule will remain in force except in restaurants, events where guests are seated, in schools and in swimming pools and bathing facilities; there, the social distancing requirement will be 1 metre.\n\nFace masks: The requirement to wear face masks will be relaxed; for example, it will be abolished in shops and workplaces. The requirement will apply only at events where guests or audience members are seated, i.e. at stage performances, in cinemas, in church, at sporting events and other similar gatherings. Face-masks must also be worn by those performing services where proximity is inevitable, such as hairdressing salons, massage facilities and similar places. Healthcare facilities may make more stringent demands regarding the use of face masks.\n\nSwimming pools, bathing facilities, camp sites, skiing facilities, galleries and museums may admit the full number of guests for which they are licensed instead of the 75% rule applying hitherto.\n\nFitness centres may admit the full number of guests for which they are licensed instead of the 75% rule applying hitherto; however, this shall be done in such a way that not more than 150 guests occupy each separate area at a time.\n\nEvents with seated audiences: The maximum number of persons in each restricted area at such events is now raised from 150 to 300. Refreshments, including alcoholic beverages, may be served during intervals. The face-mask requirement applies at these events.\n\nShops: Where there is currently a limit of 200 customers, no such maximum shall apply. However, the rule on the number of customers relative to the floor area of the shop shall remain in force.\n\nRestaurants: The opening time of restaurants is extended by one hour, from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. Guests shall have left the premises by midnight.\n\nSchools: The regulations imposing restrictions on activities in schools is repealed. Instead, the general rules limiting the size of gatherings shall apply in schools.\u00a0\n\n\nCovid-19: Od 25 maja znaczne z\u0142agodzenia ogranicze\u0144 dotycz\u0105cych zgromadze\u0144", "id": "ef11496c42433e1a912d1a1d947d1c98"}

The heaviest focus has been on testing, contact tracing and quarantine of individuals considered to be likely carriers. Furthermore, very strict measures have been in place for several weeks to protect the groups considered most vulnerable from infection as well as measures to minimize the risk of infection at medical establishments.\nAccording to numbers published by the government on Wednesday 25 March, a total of 11 727 individuals have been tested for the virus that causes COVID-19. This translates to 32 217 on a per million basis. This is the highest proportion of tests performed by any individual country.\nThe tests have been performed on two different cohorts.\nA total of 5 564 tests have been performed by the National University hospital of Iceland in Reykjav\u00edk, mostly on individuals who were symptomatic or were considered to be likely to have contracted the virus due to proximity to infected individuals or other reasons. Out of these 5 564 tests, 4 879 have been negative and 685 positive.\nA total of 6 163 tests have been performed on the general population, individuals who had not been ordered to quarantine and were generally asymptomatic or showed mild symptoms. Out of these 6 163 tests, 6 111 have been negative and 52 positive.\nAs of today a total of 737 have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Iceland. 68 people are cured. Two people who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 have died, one a tourist who showed unusual symptoms, the other an Icelander. 15 are currently hospitalized and 2 in intensive care. Of those currently identified as infected 23 are over the age of 70, the most at-risk age group.\nRestrictions on gatherings\nAs of midnight Monday 23 March, a ban on gatherings of 20 or more individuals has taken effect in Iceland. These measures were put in place following recommendations from the Chief Epidemiologist to Svand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir Icelands\u2018s Minister of Health.

{"date": "June 18, 2018", "title": "Speech by the Prime Minister, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, on Iceland's National Day, June 17th 2018", "content": "Fellow Icelanders.\nAt the beginning of December 1918, Elka Bj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir, a labourer in Reykjavik, wrote an entry in her journal, as she did at the end of each workday. Elka was 37 years old at the time, and had kept a diary for over a decade. Her writings give us unique insight into the lives of ordinary workers in the early 20th century, before the foundations of the Icelandic welfare system were laid.\nOne entry in the journal stands out, including the following:\nThe festivities were brief but fine. If things had been otherwise than they are today, if the threat of the epidemic were not still hanging over us and paralysing everyone in the country, then no doubt the celebrations would have been as festive as the occasion deserved. [\u2026] \nBut this was better than nothing, and the Lord gave us such fine weather to make it memorable. Many vessels flew their flags, some of them even with banners strung up, and the Icelandic flag atop their masts. This is a great day in the history of this country, if it gets to be longer. A milestone, independence gained once more, after six and a half centuries. What a time of humiliation, struggling and oppression and a new beginning. Lord knows what\u2019s ahead of us.\nEarlier in her diary entry Elka had described celebrations that took place on that day, December 1st, 1918, when Iceland became a sovereign state. She spoke of the twenty-one gun salute, from the Danish vessel Islands falk which was anchored out beyond the harbour, in honour of the Icelandic flag, which a short time before had been hoisted on its own above Government Offices for the first time. And Elka recounted how the country\u2019s main notables had gathered to celebrate the nation\u2019s sovereignty. She herself had without a doubt been absolutely certain who was who in that group, as Elka was known to be \u201cas uppity as a lord\u201d, as people said in those days. She worked cleaning offices in Reykjav\u00edk.\nBut Elka was no less notable herself, a true leader in her community despite poor health. A few years earlier she had taken part in founding both the women\u2019s trade union Frams\u00f3kn and the social democratic party of Iceland Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0uflokkur. A woman who was made of stern stuff.\nRecently Elka\u2019s voice was heard once more, although only briefly. An excerpt from her diary entry was read on Icelandic National Broadcasting when several dozen Icelanders who lived here in the capital a century ago were given a chance to be heard again, one each day.\nBut what do 100-year-old journal entries matter? What significance can people who lived in Iceland 100 years ago have for us today?\nElka Bj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir was not at all sure what the future would bring. She asked herself whether the country\u2019s history would be longer. Understandably enough, in the light of the Spanish flu, which had then ravaged for several weeks with horrendous consequences, the volcano Katla, which had only ceased to spew forth fire from its depths a month earlier, and the severe cold of the previous winter, still fresh in everyone\u2019s mind.\n Much has changed in our attitudes towards the past and the history of Iceland in recent years. More voices from the past have fortunately gained an audience. History is focused much less than before on eminent men and notable leaders. All kinds of people who have lived in this country and on this earth have gained a voice and reshaped our history.\nThese hundred-year-old journal entries give us pause to consider the lives and conditions of people who lived at that time. To imagine as well the society where women forty years of age and older had only three years earlier gained the right to vote, and where decisions were made in a manner quite different to what we know today. Our society has truly changed in the space of a century. Its voices are greater in number and in variety than in Iceland in 1918, which is good, because the need is urgent for talent and ability in different fields, for ideas, diligence and ambition. In a small nation every individual makes a difference, which is why we should welcome the variety of voices contributing to our joint democratic project. It\u2019s up to us to strengthen that democracy, not only by turning up at the polling station now and again, to slide an ever-lengthening ballot into the ballot box, but also through active discussion in different forms. Our task is to debate thoughtfully, express our minds and last but not least listen carefully to one another.\nThese days it is easy to let the outside world know of your opinions and thoughts. We need only to pick up our phone and the floor is ours. Just as the voices are more varied so too are the routes we have more varied to speak to our entire society, encouraging campaigners to place anything and everything on the agenda. But let\u2019s not forget that it is still possible to communicate by that tried and true means, to sit down at the next kitchen table, or even out of doors, look each other in the eye and talk person-to-person. \n\nFellow Icelanders.\nThese days we\u2019re watching an advanced course in top-flight communication and cohesion, as the Icelandic men\u2019s football team takes part in the world\u2019s largest sporting event, the World Cup itself. In sport, the reality is clear on the surface: to win is always better than to lose, and in football you need to score more goals than your opponent. But underneath that there is much more: dedication, ambition and endless hard work all underlie success. The mind needs to be clearly focused on each task. It is no coincidence that the Icelandic team\u2019s coaches have put their greatest emphasis on team spirit. Such spirit does not arise of itself and is one of the most valuable lessons sport can teach us. First and foremost, this is a message for future generations that those of us born here on this island can know few limits.\nFellow Icelanders.\nA hundred years ago no one probably would have dreamed that a sporting team from this almost incredibly small island nation could play world class football, the smallest nation ever to achieve such success. And we cannot really believe it yet: we swing between regarding all that Iceland has achieved as either incredible or as simply a matter of course. Not unlike Elka, we are seeking security and balance, we face challenges and uncertainty, with the forces of nature and weather always in our thoughts.\nThe past will continue to have many lessons to teach us. This autumn, for example, a decade will have passed since the economic collapse. Those events have tainted all our political agenda ever since, and perhaps all our existence as a nation. Understanding what happened and endeavouring to learn from the mistakes is important to avoid ending up in such pitfalls again. At the same time, it is important to assure ourselves that we have definitely put this behind us, and the shackles of the collapse have been removed.\nOn the 1st of December this year we will celebrate a century of sovereignty. Among the measures adopted by the Althingi to mark the occasion is an action plan for the development of language technology infrastructure for the Icelandic language. We look to the future and to meeting the challenges it will bring. Changes to the natural environment, communications or lack of communications between large nations in far-off countries, and technological innovations that will transform the future world of work \u2013 these are some of the challenges we know of. We need to set ambitious climate targets, be a voice for human rights and natural conservation, and prepare ourselves for the future challenges in how we work. The enormous advances already made in technology have begun to shape our lives, our society and our very selves.\nSocial media and search engines specifically programmed to do so have already influenced our political debate, primarily with statements that are limited to 280 characters. This fact has meant that deeper political debate is being pushed aside. What will this lead to? Will technological change contribute to still more disintegration of a political environment that is already characterized by the view that co-operation and compromise, which has long underpinned democratic society, is now a fault rather than an advantage? International co-operation is no less under attack, walls are to be erected between countries and ever more people appear to view obstinacy as a prime virtue.\nThe technological revolution affects not only politics; it will transform our entire society, not least industry and the labour market. Here in Iceland we have every opportunity of becoming actors in the technological revolution rather than waiting at the receiving end. History shows us that daring and vision have never been lacking in this country, and it is our responsibility to move ahead with the changes of the future, to ensure continuing prosperity and equality. However, this may not be the most complicated task: that will be to ensure that our humanity is not lost in this fast-paced revolution. The ethical issues we face must be dealt with, along with the question of what it means to be human. In approaching that task, we need to take advantage of human creativity and critical thinking; the ability to think independently will probably be the most important instrument for preserving just than humanity.\nFellow Icelanders.\nFestive days such as the 17th of June and the 1st of December remind us that we rest on the laurels of those generations that preceded us. We need to constantly seek ways to make our own contribution, to pave the way for a better society in Iceland. This is in fact a good country and a good society. We must never forget that we live here despite many a prophecy to the contrary through the centuries, because we have a good life here and despite everything \u2013 we care about each other. Which is likely most precious of all.\nFellow Icelanders, I wish you a happy 17th of June holiday!", "id": "f49b366c86d3383ba95a801cd0a69b38"}

The package is equivalent to ISK 230 bn (USD 1.6 bn) or just under 8% of Icelandic GDP. The Government aims to safeguard the economic livelihood of people and businesses, protecting the welfare system and creating a strong demand in the economy.\nToday\u2019s measures protect jobs and make it easier for people and businesses to cope with a temporary loss of income.\nWages Secured\n\nIn order to protect jobs and employment relationships between Icelandic workers and their employers during these extraordinary times, the Government of Iceland has committed to allowing part-time workers to claim up to 75 per cent of unemployment benefits, to avoid job losses. \n\nThose who are under threat of losing their jobs will become eligible for unemployment benefits which allow them to move to part time hours for their employer and claim additional support from the Government. The benefit package allows those who cut back to as low as 25% of their previous employment hours or salary to boost the earnings they receive from their employer with Government support up to a combined level of ISK 700,000 per month.\n\nThe overall aim of this legislation is to encourage businesses to keep employees on their payrolls, rather than lay them off. The self-employed and freelancers are also eligible for this benefit.\nTaxes Postponed \nCompanies will be given the opportunity to postpone the payment of taxes until next year to improve liquidity in business operations. Hotel taxes will be abolished until the end of 2021. \nReductions in bank taxes and state guarantees on loans to eligible companies are designed to increase the opportunities for lending, allowing companies to continue business and protect salary payments. \nBy helping companies maintain the relationship between workers and employers the time required for companies to return to business-as-usual will be shortened as circumstances change. \nFocus on Households\nThe well-being of families and households in Iceland is at the core of these measures. Already, people under quarantine have a secure income, which is key to allowing people to make responsible decisions to reduce the spread of the virus. This short-term measure is intended to protect jobs and income during the economic downturn. \n\nDuring the next 15 months, people can withdraw a monthly sum from their voluntary pension savings, to a maximum of ISK 800,000. VAT reimbursement for construction and maintenance work will increase from 60% to 100%. In addition, the VAT reimbursement provision will be extended to the third sector organisations including charities and sports associations. \n\nFinally, a one-off child benefit payment will be made on June 1, 2020 to all families with children under the age of 18. Parents with an average monthly income below ISK 927,000 in 2019 will receive ISK 40,000 per child and those with higher income will receive ISK 20,000 per child.\nSpecial ISK 20 bn Investment Initiative\nThis year, the Government of Iceland, along with local municipalities, will initiate a special project, aimed at increasing investment in transport, public construction and technology infrastructure. Government contributions to research and science will also be increased. Details of this project will be announced at a later dat\nFor further information please see here.\nResilience: Strengthening Iceland's foothold - Presentation", "id": "f60c974c723d3ba09d3c4f6771d8f6d0"}

The Minister and the Executive Director discussed their shared commitment to financing for gender equality and the role that sovereigns play in this endeavour as well as opportunities to amplify the capital markets\u2019 role. \n\nUN Women has a clear vision to increase public and private financing policies, strategies and instruments to advance gender equality by providing tailored policy guidance and capacity building on the mobilization, allocation and spending of high impact financing aligned with gender equality objectives. \n\nWhile Iceland ranks as one of the most gender equal countries in the world and has topped the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index for the past 13 years, there are still persisting gender gaps that need to be addressed. Recognizing the importance that financing plays in achieving gender equality gender responsive budgeting was implemented more than a decade ago and has served as a key tool in enhancing evidence on the gender impact of resource allocation and facilitated more informed decision-making in the budgeting process. \n\nThe government also acknowledges the role that capital markets can play in allocating capital towards projects and investments that promote gender equality. Last year the Ministry issued a Sovereign Sustainable Financing Framework\u00a0that enables the Government to issue sustainable, green, blue, and/or social bonds to finance its activities for climate, environment and social issues, including projects that promote gender equality. \nBjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs: \n\u201cThe Government of Iceland is very committed to gender equality and we wish to lead by example and continue being at the forefront in leveraging tools on public finance management in the work towards gender equality.

The discussion centered on the importance of transforming mentalities and engaging men and boys to address the root causes of violence against women. Audrey Azoulay, Director General of UNESCO, also participated in the\u00a0discussion.\nPrime minister Jakobsdottir highlighted the importance of legislative measures and policies in Iceland\u2019s progress towards gender equality. She talked about Iceland\u00b4s first comprehensive policy towards preventing sexual and gender-based violence and harassment with an action plan for the next four years. The plan\u00b4s objective is to increase education on how to prevent and react to gender-based violence, and to raise general awareness and deepen people\u00b4s understanding of the causes and effects of this type of violence. Prime minister Jakobsdottir, also talked about the Icelandic parental leave legislation implemented in 2000, granting both parents equal a non-transferrable right to paid parental leave, was a major milestone in transferring gender roles and including men to be a part of the solution.\u00a0 Further, the Barbershop concept was developed in Iceland as a way of getting men involved as partners in promoting gender equality.\nThe prime minister also pointed out how the global backlash on gender equality has become even stronger as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. She emphasized that when plans are made to recover from COVID-19 gender responsive measures must be included in all recovery efforts.\nKatr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, Prime Minister:\n\u201cWe are far from eliminating violence against women and girls. This has been illustrated both by the #MeToo movement and the alarming escalation in gender-based violence against women we\u00b4ve seen as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Violence against women is both the cause and the consequence of broader societal inequalities between men and women, and we must do all we can to end it. In Iceland we have focused on the rights of survivors and have taken legislative steps to increase these rights. We\u00b4ve aimed to improve survivor\u00b4s trust and access to the judicial system, for instance by improving the quality and speed of investigations. We have also worked actively to include men in the conversation about gender inequalities and have invited them to be part of the solution.\u201d\nIn 1999 the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution designating the 25th\u00a0of November as the International Day for the elimination of violence against women.

The project is in partnership with Kenyan partners Geothermal Development Company and Rosekey Foods. An agreement for funding by the Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs\u2018\u00a0Sustainable Development Goals Partnership Fund\u00a0was signed 12 March.\nTea production is a very important, albeit polluting, industry in Kenya. Utilization of geothermal heat can have a very positive impact on food security and the environmental impact of the industry. The project supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially goal eight on decent work and economic growth, goal twelve on responsible consumption and production and goal thirteen on climate action. The project has the potential to significantly decrease Kenya\u2018s CO2 emissions. In 2002 an estimated 155,000 tons of wood were burned in Kenya to dry tea and other foods. About 1.8 tons of CO2 are released for every ton of wood burned. In 2002, an estimated 300.000 tons of CO2 were thus released into the atmosphere to dry food in Kenya. It is clear that significant amounts of CO2 emissions can be avoided by replacing wood burning with geothermal heat.\nThe project is a partnership between consulting firm Intellecon and law firm BBA//Fjeldco. Both firms have extensive and growing experience in geothermal and other sustainable energy projects in developing countries. If the project is successful, there are hopes that more opportunities could follow for job creation and economic development in Kenya along the lines of developing cooperation in energy and food production.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals Partnership Fund supports Icelandic private sector firms who want to work towards the United Nations\u2018 Sustainable Development Goals by launching co-operative ventures in developing countries. By participating, private sector firms can support increased economic activity in developing countries and enhance their own competitiveness in emerging markets.

The report sets out scenarios for possible evolution of the fund over the coming decades, given assumed continued operating losses, and explains the impact thereof on the Treasury given its guarantee of collection for the Fund\u2019s liabilities. A guarantee of collection means that when a confirmation is established that the debtor is unable to make payments and does not have assets to secure the obligation, the guarantee will be effective. With a guarantee of collection the Treasury guarantees repayment of the debts\u2019 nominal value, plus accrued interest, and inflation indexation until the settlement date. \n\nThe Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs is expected to present the contents of the report to Althingi on 25th of October. \n\nThe HF-Fund was created through the split of the Housing Financing Fund (HFF) by Act No. 151/2019, which came into effect on 31 December 2019. The workout of the HF-Fund\u2019s assets and liabilities is aimed at minimising the risk and cost to the Treasury stemming from the HFF\u2019s cumulative financial difficulties. These financial difficulties result from the HFF\u2019s activities and funding arrangements coupled with large-scale prepayments on its loan portfolio. A special panel was appointed this spring to advise on the process. \n\nThe report\u2019s findings, which are based on the Fund\u2019s position as presented in its 2022 interim results, show that the Fund is able to pay the principal and interest on its obligations until 2034, and that no later than that year the Treasury\u2019s guarantee will be tested. The Fund\u2019s equity position at that point is projected to be negative by approximately ISK 260 bn, or a present value of ISK 170 bn. Continuing to operate the Fund throughout its debt maturity horizon would require the Treasury to inject approximately ISK 450 bn, or ISK 200 bn at present value, into the Fund. If, on the other hand, the Fund would be liquidated at the current juncture and its assets sold and used to repay debts, the negative balance would amount to ISK 47 bn.\u00a0On the graph below the blue column stands for nominal value and the orange is present value.\n\n\n\nA decision needs to be taken on how to deal with this situation, including whether to allocate additional funds to the HF-Fund. As demonstrated in the report, there are arguments supporting the case for starting to seek ways to liquidate the HF-Fund so that its assets can be disposed of and its debts settled. With each passing month, the cost of the settlement for the Treasury can be expected to increase by ISK 1.5 bn, or ISK 18 bn per year. Therefore, it is important and responsible towards future generations and creditors to complete the settlement sooner rather than later, which would serve to minimise uncertainty and put an end to the continuing lossmaking and growth in the amount to be covered by the guarantee.\n\nIt is also important for the HF-Fund\u2019s creditors to have timely and clear information on how the Treasury intends to deal with these issues. The Ministry deems it important to engage in a dialogue with the creditors and examine the basis for agreements on the settlement and liquidation of the Fund, which must be considered the optimal result and could bring a favourable outcome for all stakeholders. Stein\u00fe\u00f3r P\u00e1lsson has been engaged to act as an intermediary in this dialogue, having extensive experience in the financial services sector, including as CEO of Landsbankinn.\n\nReport: The Minister of Finace and Economic Affairs on the HF Fund\n\n\nReport on HF Fund - Summary", "id": "fbd9e11fc8d13a049e18b06bfd5d2f9b"}

The main purpose of the exercise is to practice the defence of the sea routes around Iceland and important security infrastructure, as well as search and rescue operations at sea and on land. Northern Viking is a periodic joint defence exercise of Iceland and the United States, with the participation of other allied and partner nations.\n\nThe Northern Viking defence exercise has been held since 1982 and is based on the provisions of the 1951 Defence Agreement between Iceland and the United States. The exercise was originally scheduled to take place in early 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\n\nThe aim of the exercise includes practising the defence of the sea routes around Iceland and of important structures and security infrastructure, e.g. telecommunications cables. The participants will also practice the search and rescue of civilians, with the Icelandic Coast Guard and police. Northern Viking includes an amphibious landing of American marines at Mi\u00f0sandur in Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. The landing is planned for 11 April and temporary traffic restrictions may be expected in the area on the day. Members of the media will be invited to observe the exercise and related events, to the extent possible.\n\nThe exercise is open for participation of NATO allies and partners. The naval forces of the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Norway have confirmed participation. Military vessels from these states will practice defending the sea routes to the south of Iceland and will participate in a submarine search off the coast of Iceland, with anti-submarine aircraft and helicopters.\n\nJust over 700 participants are expected to take part in the exercise in Iceland, around half of whom will be situated at Keflav\u00edk Air Base.

In recognition of the Council\u2019s 25th anniversary, the Ministers adopted Council\u2019s first ever Strategic Plan\u00a0that reflects the shared values, goals and joint aspirations of the Arctic States and Indigenous Permanent Participants. It will guide the Council\u2019s work for the next decade.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that our Chairmanship has been everything but ordinary! The COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a halt as well as our Chairmanship plans at half term,\u201d said Iceland\u2019s Foreign Minister Gudlaugur Th\u00f3r Th\u00f3r\u00f0arson. \u201cI am extremely proud that our Senior Arctic Officials have been able to agree on the first ever Strategic Plan for the Arctic Council. Through the Strategic Plan, we will for the first time be able to give long term guidance to the work of the Council.\u201d\nDuring its Chairmanship, Iceland emphasized work on the Arctic marine environment, climate and green energy solutions, people and communities in the Arctic, and strengthening the Arctic Council. The accomplishments of the Council during the Icelandic Chairmanship include deliverables that strengthen the knowledgebase on Arctic shipping and enhance emergency response in Arctic waters, assess climate impacts on Arctic ecosystems, reduce pollution, promote the wellbeing of Arctic inhabitants, and much more.\u00a0\nMajor reports adopted at the Ministerial meeting include the Arctic Climate Change Update 2021, the State of the Arctic Terrestrial Biodiversity Report, a Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic, Gender Equality in the Arctic report, the Summary of Progress and Recommendations from the Council\u2019s Expert Group on Black Carbon and Methane, to name a few. All deliverables will shortly be available via the Arctic Council\u2019s open archive.\nThe incoming Chairmanship of the Russian Federation will continue to support many ongoing activities of the Council\u2019s Working Groups and other subsidiary bodies, while introducing a number of new projects and initiatives. Sustainable development will be the main overarching priority of the Russian Chairmanship, with the human dimension, the environment and sustainable economic growth as key areas.\u00a0\n\u201cToday, the Arctic is steadily establishing itself on the international agenda as a region of fruitful cooperation. Responsible Arctic governance is only possible on the basis of a genuine partnership of countries that bear special responsibility for its fate,\u201d stated the Russian Federation\u2019s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov. \u201cI am delighted to note that this engagement is largely possible due to the work of the Arctic Council.

Despite its small sized economy, the country has built sizeable buffers which help mitigate its vulnerability to external shocks and balance of payments\u2019 risks; including ample foreign reserves, and a comfortable fiscal cash buffer. Strong credit fundamentals also include the country\u2019s sizeable pension fund assets, sound banking sector, and strong private sector balance sheets. The rating remains constrained by a high level of public debt and the small size of the economy with its limited export diversification.\nIceland\u2019s post-pandemic recovery strengthened in 2022. The economy expanded by 6.4%, underpinned by robust domestic demand. Tighter monetary policy and still elevated inflation, will mean a lower positive contribution from domestic demand. Although households\u2019 disposable income will benefit from the latest wage negotiations, higher inflation and interest rates have increased their debt-servicing burdens. Subdued investment growth is also forecast. Weaker global growth is expected to weigh on net exports. Fitch estimates general government debt returned to its pre-pandemic ratio in 2022, declining to 66.5% of GDP, from 75.4% in 2021. The sovereign has a high degree of fiscal financing flexibility, underpinned by a large general government deposit buffer (Fitch estimates 11.5% of GDP end 2022) and robust liquidity in the banking system.\nIceland has an ESG Relevance Score (RS) of '5[+]' for both Political Stability and Rights and for the Rule of Law, Institutional and Regulatory Quality and Control of Corruption.\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\nPublic Finances: A sharp and sustained decline in the government debt/GDP ratio.\nMacro: Higher trend growth and evidence of economic diversification that reduces Iceland\u00b4s vulnerability to external shocks.\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade: \nPublic Finances: Looser fiscal policy that places the government debt/GDP ratio on an upward trajectory.\nMacro: An adverse economic shock, for example due to a sharp correction in the real estate market.\n\nFitch - Report", "id": "fe5a7c490ebc3a0e86462c639bc1eed2"}

A child who travels with an individual who is subject to stay in quarantine shall stay with that person and can leave the quarantine if the second test of its co-traveller is negative. When the co-traveller is not required to stay in quarantine the same shall apply to the child. A child travelling alone is not required to stay in quarantine.\n\nTesting of individuals carrying a certificate: The requirement of testing individuals carrying a vaccination certificate, or a certificate of prior infection is adopted due to indications that those individuals can pass on infections. They are not required to stay in quarantine but shall wait for the result of the test at their place of stay. The requirement is temporary and will be reviewed on the 1st of May.\n\nDefined risk zones: Those arriving from certain defined risk zones shall stay in quarantine or isolated in a quarantine facility.

The economic outlook for coming months is highly uncertain, and it is therefore difficult to estimate the Treasury\u2019s borrowing need for the current year. It is also uncertain how much of that need will be for short-term borrowing and how much for long-term borrowing.\nIt should be noted that Iceland\u2019s Government debt level is low. Total debt amounts to about 854 b.kr., or roughly 27.5% of GDP. No domestic issues are scheduled to mature for the remainder of 2020, and foreign maturities total only 292 million euros (45 b.kr.), due in July.\nThe Treasury can obtain market financing in a number of ways. It can issue more bonds in the domestic market, as issuance according to the 2020 calendar is at a historical low of about 40 b.kr. It can also issue bonds abroad. Moreover, the Treasury can address a deteriorating cash position by issuing Treasury bills or taking short-term money market loans. The Treasury\u2019s liquidity position in Icelandic kr\u00f3nur currently totals 44 b.kr. Finally, the Treasury holds the equivalent of 169 b.kr. in foreign currency deposits with the Central Bank. Its position is therefore sound, and there is no reason to fear that the Treasury will be unable to handle the expected fall in revenues and increased financing need in the weeks and months to come if such expectations should materialise. \nRevision of Q2/2020 issuance\n\nIt has been decided to increase Treasury bond issuance in Q2/2020 to a maximum of 40 b.kr. Further details will be published in the Quarterly Government Debt Management Prospect at the end of this month. This means that issuance for the year will increase substantially relative to the previously published annual Prospect.\n\nIt is difficult at present to estimate the total need for Treasury issuance in 2020. Before decisions can be made, more detailed information on the Treasury\u2019s borrowing need is needed.
